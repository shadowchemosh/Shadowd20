A creature dies if this Charisma damage equals or exceeds its actual Charisma score, releasing 1d3 shadows as its swollen neck explodes; Cure 2 consecutive saves\n\nShortly after Stepan reneged on his agreement with Nicasor, the shae&apos;s rage infused the shadow essence that leaked from the midnight mirror and manifested in the Material Plane as a strange new disease that locals of Karpad have named tallowthroat. Victims sweat constantly, giving their skin a waxy appearance, and their throats swell as though suffering from goiter as the shadow essence infusing them takes form into hostile creatures. An infected creature becomes increasingly irritable, to the point of possessing an attitude of unfriendly with even its closest friends and relatives. Intimidate check DCs are treated as Diplomacy checks to change an infected creature&apos;s starting attitude (regardless of the actual skill used).\n\nBecause of their ties to the Plane of Shadow, fetchlings are immune to the effects of tallowthroat, though they often act as carriers; only the town&apos;s existing system of fetchling segregation has prevented the spread of the disease to the entire town. In fact, it was the fetchling Sergyev, a groundskeeper at Baroi Manor, who first came into contact with the disease, which leaked into the Material Plane through the water in the manor&apos;s courtyard fountain. Sergyev spread the disease to several other members of the household staff, and later around Karpad when Stepan fired all but one of the fetchlings working in the manor." compset="InPlay">
