  <thing id="iruBloodfl" name="Bloodflame Ring" description=" This beautiful adamantine ring is warm to the touch. Artful pictures etched inside it tell the tale of its creation; the imagery claims that this ring was one of the first items crafted by employing heat to coerce metal into shape. When worn, it transforms your blood into pure molten iron, which does not harm you, and provides certain benefits: You gain the fire subtype. Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that drain blood (such as stirges and vampires) take the standard fire damage for attacking you and you do not suffer any effects of their blood drain special ability. You count as a ferrous creature for the purpose of rusting grasp and similar effects.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Forge Ring, fire shield, iron body; Cost 13,000 gp" compset="Ring">
