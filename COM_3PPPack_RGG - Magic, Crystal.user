  <thing id="spCMCryCn3" name="Crystal Council" description="The crystal council spell can be cast one of two ways&#151;to create a council between a number of creatures, or to establish contact among those members of an existing council who are within range.\n\nTo establish a council, all creatures must be willing, must be touching you, and each must have and be touching a viewing\ncrystal that is capable of being the focus for this spell. You may include up to one willing creature per caster level as part of the council. When using the spell this way, its duration is instantaneous. You cannot change creatures included the council. If you wish to add or subtract members of the council, you must gather together all creatures to be included in the new council and cast the spell again. Each viewing\ncrystal may only be associated with one council at any given time. If a new crystal council spell is cast on a viewing crystal, it is disconnected from the previous council and its owner is no longer considered to be part of that council. If a new crystal council spell is cast on the crystal use by a spellcaster to form a council, then the previous council is\ndisbanded entirely. A creature can be part of multiple councils, but must have a separate viewing crystal for each one.\n\nThe other way to cast this spell is to use it to communicate mentally with all members of an existing council. The spell affects all willing members of the council who have in their possession the viewing crystal they used when forming the council. For one minute per casting level, the members of the\ncouncil can freely and silently communicate with each other mentally. Anything communicated through the crystal is sent\nto everyone in the council, making private conversations difficult. Language is a barrier, though, so if two members of the council share a language not known to other members, they may speak mentally to each other in that language. Sending a message is a move action, though the message may be of any length. Receiving messages requires no action.\n\nThis mental communication only works if the spell energy can freely travel between council members. Normally the\ncommunication can get through to anyone on the same plane of existence, but if a member is totally sealed off from all forms of energy, he is unable to send or receive\ncommunication. Similarly, it is impossible to communitcate with creatures on other plan es (including the ethereal plane)." compset="Spell">

For the\nduration of the spell, any time you make a Heal check to treat disease or treat poison, if your Heal check exceeds the DC of the affliction your subject gains a +8 competence  bonus to his saving throw (rather than the normal +4).\n\nAdditionally, if you treat a patient for a full day (using the long term care function of the Heal skill), you may grant that patient a new saving throw against any curse he is suffering. The subject may make a new saving throw against the curse (with the same DC as when he was initially afflicted).

  <thing id="spCMCryCn6" name="Crystal Council" description="The crystal council spell can be cast one of two ways&#151;to create a council between a number of creatures, or to establish contact among those members of an existing council who are within range.\n\nTo establish a council, all creatures must be willing, must be touching you, and each must have and be touching a viewing\ncrystal that is capable of being the focus for this spell. You may include up to one willing creature per caster level as part of the council. When using the spell this way, its duration is instantaneous. You cannot change creatures included the council. If you wish to add or subtract members of the council, you must gather together all creatures to be included in the new council and cast the spell again. Each viewing\ncrystal may only be associated with one council at any given time. If a new crystal council spell is cast on a viewing crystal, it is disconnected from the previous council and its owner is no longer considered to be part of that council. If a new crystal council spell is cast on the crystal use by a spellcaster to form a council, then the previous council is\ndisbanded entirely. A creature can be part of multiple councils, but must have a separate viewing crystal for each one.\n\nThe other way to cast this spell is to use it to communicate mentally with all members of an existing council. The spell affects all willing members of the council who have in their possession the viewing crystal they used when forming the council. For one minute per casting level, the members of the\ncouncil can freely and silently communicate with each other mentally. Anything communicated through the crystal is sent\nto everyone in the council, making private conversations difficult. Language is a barrier, though, so if two members of the council share a language not known to other members, they may speak mentally to each other in that language. Sending a message is a move action, though the message may be of any length. Receiving messages requires no action.\n\nThis mental communication only works if the spell energy can freely travel between council members. Normally the\ncommunication can get through to anyone on the same plane of existence, but if a member is totally sealed off from all forms of energy, he is unable to send or receive\ncommunication. Similarly, it is impossible to communitcate with creatures on other plan es (including the ethereal plane)." compset="Spell">
