  <thing id="isuRightRu" name="Staff of Rightful Rule" description=" The staff is a single piece of mithral carved with lines and small dots and encrusted with blue and violet gemstones at either end. The runes marking it are a mixture of Auran and Infernal terms, intertwined. Holding the staff delivers a shocking grasp to any creature other than the staff's owner, and no chaotic creature can become its owner. Asserting ownership requires a DC 20 Use Magic Device check or a DC 20 Charisma check while holding the staff. Once you become the staff's owner, you remain so until another creature asserts ownership.\n\nA staff of rightful rule has 50 charges when it is created. Spent charges can be restored by casting dictum into the staff. Each casting restores one charge, and the staff cannot hold more than 50 charges at any one time.\n\nThe staff allows use of the following spells:\n\n    Feather fall (0 charges; functions even if all charges expended)\n    Chain lightning (2 charges)\n    Dispel chaos (3 charges)\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}\nA staff of rightful rule may be destroyed by a word of chaos spell targeted at the staff. The caster of the spell must make a DC 30 Caster Level check to destroy the staff. If he fails this check, the staff deals 10d6 points of damage to him." compset="Staff">

  <thing id="iouPropSta" name="Prophecies of the Blind Star-God" description=" Prophecies of the Blind Star-God is a simple book of black leather with corner and spine reinforcements of tarnished silver. Its 166 vellum pages are written in a thin, spidery hand. Each chapter opens with an illumination that shows some otherworldly monstrosity or an act of human sacrifice, necromancy, or adulation of statues of a tentacled beast. An eight-pointed star figures prominently in the marginalia and in diapering along the bottom page borders.\n\nThe book creates two different effects.\n\n{b}Confuse One's Enemies:{/b} Reading aloud from the book is a standard action that acts as a confusion spell on all creatures within 30 feet. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. The Will save DC equals 10 plus your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability at will.\n\n{b}Commune with Madness:{/b} Once per month, you can magically divine the wishes of the Blind Star-God or his agents. This ability functions as a commune spell (CL 20th). The prophecies provide information to aid cultist decisions, but at a price. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes, and each reading of the book permanently lowers your Wisdom by 1 point. This is not a drain effect. Only wish or miracle can recover your Wisdom score if lowered in this way, and then at only 1 point per spell cast." compset="Wondrous">
