  <thing id="deiBloodVl" name="Blood of Vol, The" description="The Blood of Vol cult attracts followers fascinated by death and the undead.  The most dedicated of these revere an ancient lich who calls herself Vol, Queen of the Dead.  The Blood flows into the distant past, through the earliest days of human civilization on Khorvaire, to the elf kingdom of Aerenal, and even to Xen&apos;drik, the continent of secrets.  Vol and her followers see undeath as a path to divinity, invoking negative energy in contrast to the positive energy that powers the Undying Court.  They are captivated by the figurative and literal meaning of blood and by heredity, seeking to manipulate bloodlines to accomplish some fiendish purpose.  Vol herself is a powerful necromancer who has unlocked the secrets of undead creation. Clerics of the Blood of Vol are lawful evil.  They have access to the domains of Death, Evil, Law, and Necromancer.  The cult&apos;s favored weapon is the dagger." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="deiCultDrg" name="Cult of the Dragon Below" description="The Cults of the Dragon Below consist of a diverse group of fanatical sects that revere the power of the subterranean realms.  Some of these cults seek to draw Khyber, the Dragon Below, up from the depths of the world, while others traffic with demons conjured from the deep regions.  A few seek a promised paradise in some lost cavern far below the surface, purifying themselves with blood sacrifice to make themselves worthy to find it.  Though little unites these mad cults beyond their reverence for the forbidden powers of Khyber, they are generally neutral evil, and all choose their domains from among Dragon Below, Earth, Evil and Madness.  Their favored weapon is the heavy pick." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
