Most alarm bells have the features of a canine or  porcine beast with an open mouth, from which most of the bell&#146;s sound issues forth.\n\nOnce per day, an alarm bell can be set to ward an area as large as a 20-foot-radius. If the bell is tied to a string, cord, or similar item that forms a perimeter smaller than a 20-foot-radius, it wards only the area within the perimeter. When set, the alarm bell rings loudly enough for anyone within 200 feet of or larger enters its warded area. When set, the alarm bell can have a password assigned to it, allowing any creature speaking the password to enter the warded area without setting off the alarm. \n\nAn alarm bell has a Perception bonus of 10 + the HD of the creature that set it. An alarm bell&#146;s warding lasts for 10 hours or until it is removed from the area warded. An alarm bell can be set to not ring for creatures of a particular type, or for creatures of a particular size, or for a combination of such features. For example, it would be possible to set an alarm bell so it would not be activated by Small or smaller animals, or not by humanoids, or not by colossal dragons, or any similar combinations. \n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Wondrous Items, alarm; Cost: 1,000 gp." compset="Wondrous">

Most of these items are tarnished and show signs of extensive wear.\n\nA distant chime can be played as a normal bell, creating a noise approximately as loud as a human shouting. As a standard action, the wielder of the chime can move the point of origin of the noise made by the bell, placing it any place within 30 feet of the bell to which he has line of sight. The sound originates from the selected point until the chime is moved out of range, at which point the chime&#146;s audible emissions once again emanate from its physical location.\n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Items, ghost sound, summon monster I; Cost: 500 gp." compset="Wondrous">

This is a ranged touch attack, with a range increment of 10 feet. If the gong hits a target, it sticks to the target and begins to vibrate. Though it makes no noise that can be heard by anyone else, the target hears the gong constantly making loud and distracting\nbooms and clashes. The target is deafened by noise only it can hear as long as the gong is attached to it.

When an amount of coin is placed on an open page and the ledger&#146;s command word spoken along with a name or code word, the coin disappears and its total value is credited to the name or code word spoken. Similarly, if the command word is given when no money sits on a page, a name or code word of an account within the ledger and an amount to be deducted can be given. Then coin equaling\nthe named amount appears. No account can ever go below 0 cp (money must be put in before it can be taken out), and the ledger can carry only a total of 10,000 coins (or any denomination) within its tallies. No matter how much coinage is kept within the ledger, it always weighs exactly 1 pound. \n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Wondrous Items, reduce person; Cost: 1,000 gp." compset="Wondrous">

It might not pick up distant or hushed conversation  (it has a Perception check of +0 to catch discreet discourse). It continues to do this for 1 hour, or until opened. The identity of those speaking are not given (each is identified simple as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, and so on), nor are such subtleties as sarcasm or irony, but an accurate record of what has been said is recorded. A live journal keeps the record of up to ten conversations. After it hits that limit, each new conversation recorded erases the oldest still on record.\n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Wondrous Items, mnemonic enhancer; Cost: 625 gp (1-slot); 1,250gp (2-slot)." compset="Wondrous">
