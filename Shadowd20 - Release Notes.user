    <info_history><![CDATA[
<strong>v2.5 August 29, 2015</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>ShadowChemosh Equipment (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #29. The auto calculating spellbooks gear item was including cantrips from opposition schools of magic.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>ShadowChemosh Conferred (ShadowChemosh) - Really fixed "Favored Enemy" to not appear twice on the Specials tab.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>I have consolidated all the Craft and Profession skills from the different packs into the Basic Pack. Updated all the skills to work with the Unchained Rules. As they are not specific to a module/AP/Monster I have removed all source marks so they will appear for everyone.</li>
<li>Changed logic for when a magus duel wields a weapon and a touch attack weapon to remove one of the foreach loops. This makes the script less CPU intensive.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v2.4 August 15, 2015</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feral Druid Archetype - Fix "Ferocious Predator Form" timing of script#1 from 100 to 600 to be AFTER the bootstrap of the different natural weapons.  This prevents the "random" size increase when the SizeChange procedure gets called in the next action.</li>
<li>Pearl of Power helper spells - These will no longer take up a spell slot.  So you can easily use them to track Pearl of Power usage on the spells tab.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Conferred (ShadowChemosh) - Really fixed "Favored Enemy" to not appear twice on the Specials tab. Made changes to have permanent affecting adjustments not display on the iPad.</li>

<ul>
<li>Darklands Campaign -Added scaling weapon "Iron Glory" throwing axe. Added the Shadow cloak of resistance +1.</li>
<li>Shadow d20 Feats - Added new feat "Piranha Strike" into the Shadow d20 house rules as this makes a great feat for martial characters using light weapons.  This feat will also count as Power Attack for the purposes of meeting Feat Pre-Req. Added new feat "Dirty Fighting" into Shadow d20 core as this makes a great replacement for Combat Expertise.</li>
<li>Merge in latest community packs.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Did enhancement #28. Added three new adjustments that allows for adding additional feat choices to classes. So in example you can use the adjustment "Class, Allowed Feats" to give Monks the ability to select the feat Vital Strike on the class tab as a bonus feat.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data File Authoring (ShadowChemosh) - Modified feats pre-req (PoW and UP) to use the new fields for testing attributes. More and more Paizo feats are coming out that allow a character to meet the pre-req's of a specific ability score.  See the new "Dirty Fighting (Combat)" on the paizo blog: http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhtr?Your-Honor-Will-Get-You-Dead I would assume that LW put in this new pre-req field to support this in future updates. So moving us to the same standards.</li>
</ul>

-Changed the behavoir of all Counters. On reset are reset back to the "max" value not zero. This means players should now count down instead of up.  So you add a Wand you can reset it 50/50 and then as you use charges you can remove. This should now work for all class abilities including Action Points.  So if I see action points of 5/12 this means you have 5 of 12 remaining. Not 7 left!

-Enhanced all Natural Weapon: XXXX adjustments with an advanced feature. You can set the damage dice of the added natural attack exactly by typing in the die tag into the Source section of the adjustment. In example typing "1d12_404" would force the damage die to be 1d12. This means the counter value will get ignored. Obviously this assumes you are familiar with the weapon tags that the Editor Uses. If you are not don't type anything in.
