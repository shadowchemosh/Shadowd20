  <thing id="ioNNWBldSy" name="Blood Syphon" description="This conical brass bowl is carved with a number of arcane sigils along the inside. It has a small hole in the center, and functions similar to a funnel. To use it, a living (or recently deceased) creature capable of being drained for blood points must be cut and made to bleed into the bowl, along the edges. A small vial is placed below the opening in the bowl, and as the blood flows over the various symbols engraved in the bowl it is affected by the bowl&apos;s magic. The blood that comes out in the vial is exceptionally thick and pitch black in color. The blood collected in this way can be stored indefinitely. Each vial is worth 1 blood point, and each creature drained in this way fills one vial per point of Constitution they possess. Additionally, Any revenant who drinks the blood in the vial can ignore his blood dependency for the next 10 days." compset="Wondrous" summary="Conical brass bowl is carved with a number of arcane sigils">

Instead, it allows the spirit of a malevolent fiend to enter the body.

Rather, a nosferatu is a fiendish entity that has possessed the corpse of the deceased creature and is using it as a means to interact with the mortal world.\n\nThe result is a sort of blending of the fiend and the original creature, and the exact balance of each depends somewhat on the strength of will of both the fiend and the individual in question, but usually the closest that a nosferatu could be considered to actually being the deceased person is being that person&apos;s &quot;evil twin,&quot; with similar personality traits, but a ruuthless, evil bent. Many of the loved ones of nosferatus have attempted to get them to &quot;snap out of it,&quot; only to discover to their chagrin that such a thing is impossible, and that the corpse they are trying to save is not their lost loved one at all.\n\nThe exact process for creating a nosferatu is dangerous and complex, but can be performed by suitably powerful wizards and clerics.

She gives a predatory grin at you and saunters over towards you, swaying her hips sensuously as she walks.{/i}\n\nRevenants are a type of vampire; undead creatures that feed upon the blood of the living. Though they are fully undead, revenants remain far closer to their humanity than other kinds of undead creatures, and most can actually masquerade as members of the living world. Unlike most other vampires, revenants need blood to continue their existence, and will eventually die without it. They also have an innate ability to tap into cruomancy, a specialized form of magic which uses stolen life essence carried in the blood of a revenant&apos;s victims to perform impressive supernatural feats.\n\n{b}Creating a Revenant{/b}: &quot;Revenant&quot; is a template which can be applied to any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A revenant uses the base creature&apos;s stats and abilities except as noted here.\n\n{b}Becoming a Revenant{/b}: It is assumed that most players who want to play revenant characters will choose to start the game as a revenant during character creation, in which case it&apos;s not of immediate concern exactly how the character became a revenant prior to the beginning of the game. That said, players in the middle of existing campaigns may find, for a number of reasons, that they would suddenly like for their existing character to become a revenant (such as because they only just acquired this book, for example). In an ideal world, such players could simply make this desire known to their GM, who could write in an encounter with a vampire that could serve as an opportunity for interested players to be &quot;turned&quot; and have their characters become revenants. But sometimes that&apos;s not an option, for whatever reason, and other times it will simply feel contrived.\n\nWith GM permission, a character could also become a revenant by performing a special ritual, much in the same way that a character can become a lich by performing a ritual and creating a phylactery. It requires a DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check to successfully identify the nature of this ritual, or to learn about it through research in a library or other place of accumulated knowledge. The ritual itself requires an hour to perform, and requires 500 gp in rare incense, ointments, and ritual objects. At the end of the ritual, the would-be revenant must wound himself (typically be cutting his wrist with a ritually anointed dagger) and bleed into a special ceremonial bowl for an extended period of time. During this time, the character suffers 1 point of damage per round, which can be stopped at any time by a successful Heal check (DC 15). If the character reaches 0 hit points, then at the beginning of his turn each round, when he takes damage from the bleeding, he may make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check succeeds, the bleeding stops, and the character immediately becomes a revenant. The character can attempt this check once per round until he either succeeds, the bleeding is stopped, or he dies." compset="Template" summary="Undead creatures that feed upon the blood of the living." uniqueness="unique">

A specific deity&apos;s prayer book or holy book could suffice, as could a major image made to appear as the holy symbol. That said, just because a deity of war has a sword for his holy symbol does not necessarily mean that any old sword will work.

Further, characters that recognize that the revenant is an undead creature generally cannot have an attitude towards the revenant that is higher than friendly, no matter how skilled the revenant is with Diplomacy (this does not prevent the target&apos;s attitude from being adjusted magically, such as with charm person).\n\nDifferent characters have different attitudes towards undead, however, and some characters may automatically be hostile and attempt to slay undead on sight, and some very rare individuals may actually have their starting attitude increased when they learn that the revenant is undead." compset="RaceCustom" summary="The revenant&apos;s appearance betray her as an inhuman creature." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rcNNWUnwel" name="Unwelcome" description="The revenant has extreme difficulty entering a home or other private place without permission. Unless the revenant is given an invitation to enter such a location by someone with the authority to do so, she must succeed on a Will save (DC 25) or be physically stopped at the entrance, unable to move forward or be moved forward by others. In the event of a failed save, the revenant cannot try to enter that location again for 24 hours.\n\nIf the revenant succeeds on the saving throw, she is able to enter the location, but suffers a -6 penalty on all of her ability scores for as long as she remains within the location, unless she receives an invitation from someone with the authority to do so while she is already inside.\n\n{b}Defining Private Places{/b}\n\nThe &quot;unwelcome&quot; weakness of the revenant template bars the revenant from entering homes and &quot;other private places,&quot; which begs the question of what, exactly, warrants a private place. While the final determination will always lie with the GM, we present the following guidelines to help determine what this ability does and does not apply to:\n\nWhile people may sleep there, the common room of an inn or similar establishment would not be considered &quot;private&quot; as it is available for public use.\n\nBy contrast, a specific rented room in an inn would likely count as such a place, as long as it was currently being rented by someone. Essentially, once the room has been rented, it is private for as long as it remains rented, as other guests are not allowed access.\n\nA private guild, gentleman&apos;s club, or other exclusive organization with a campus specifically for members only might count, depending on a few different factors. The more exclusive membership is (especially if it is based on criteria other than paying membership dues), the more likely it is to apply. Similarly, the more personal the nature of the club is, and the less that the activities that take place there have to do with work or business of any kind, the more likely it is to apply. The headquarters of a cult with elaborate initiation rituals would certainly apply, whereas the office of the local banker&apos;s guild would be less likely to.\n\nAbandoned homes, including ancient and forgotten temples and tombs, do not apply, even though they may technically be &quot;homes&quot; or &quot;private places.&quot;\n\nIn the case of buildings with a large number of residents, such as castles and keeps, especially those with multiple servants or an entire servants&apos; quarters, the building itself is not a &quot;private place&quot; for the purposes of this ability, but any individual personal quarters within the building would be." compset="RaceCustom" summary="The revenant has extreme difficulty entering a home.

This ability is a sonic effect.\n\n{i}Cat{/i}: As an immediate action, by spending 2 blood points, you can gain the evasion class feature until the beginning of your next turn.

Any creature that begins its turn or moves within 20 feet of you is automatically exposed to one of the following diseases of your choice: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The saving throw DC to resist the disease (both initially and subsequent saving throws) is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cruomancer level + your Charisma modifier.

The miasma lasts for a number of rounds equal to your cruomancer level, but those that contract the disease remain diseased until they are cured through normal means.\n\n{i}Snake{/i}: As a standard action, by spending any number of blood points, you can create and spit a single dose of poison. The poison can be of any type, but its market value cannot be more than 100 gp per blood point spent to activate the ability. If desired, the poison can be collected harmlessly, as the feat Lesser Beast Traits. Alternatively, you can choose to spit the poison. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet, and a maximum range of 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target is exposed to the poison, even if it is normally an injury, ingested, or inhaled poison.\n\n{i}Spider{/i}: As a standard action, by spending 2 blood points, you can create and throw a web. This is similar to an attack with a net, but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than you are. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cruomancer level + your Charisma modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a -4 penalty.\n\n{i}Wolf{/i}: As a standard action, by spending 3 blood points, you can let loose a fearsome howl that frightens your foes. Each living creature within 30 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 you cruomancer level + your Charisma modifier) or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to your cruomancer level. Creatures that fail their saving throws by 5 or more are frightened, instead. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect.\n\n{b}Special{/b}: You may select this feat multiple times.

In this case, culled one can be applied to any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid. It does not change the base creature&apos;s size, speed, or type, but causes the base creature to gain the ability score adjustments outlined in the culled one racial traits, as well as gain the sunlight vulnerability racial trait, and allows the base creature to gain two minor traits and one major trait, as outlined in the culled one racial traits. Applying culled one as a template in this way increases the CR of the base creature by +1\n\n{i}The man before you is unnaturally pale, his skin a nearly-translucent shade, like pure porcelain. His features are strongly chiseled, and there is an unnatural aura about him: a sort of presence that is impossible to quantify. He is not only cold to the touch, but in fact the air around him seems to chill slightly in reaction to his presence.{/i}\n\nThe culled ones, as they call themselves, are a tragic race. They are composed of those trapped between life and death: the offspring of a vampire and a mortal, or the product of a vampiric embrace improperly performed. The culled ones are something more than mortal and something less than a vampire. Reviled by both, they find themselves with few options in society, and often strike out on their own, usually attempting to hide their pseudo-vampiric nature from those they meet.\n\n{b}Physical Traits{/b}: Physically, culled ones look similar to humans, except that they have much paler skin. Their eyes are almost universally an unnatural crystal-blue color. They are always cold to the touch, usually several degrees below room temperature.\n\nThough they do not require it to survive, most culled ones feel strong urges to drink blood. This blood addiction is very strong, and only the most iron-willed of culled ones is able to go for more than a few weeks without drinking at least a few drops of animal blood.\n\n{b}Society{/b}: Culled ones who are the union of a vampire and a mortal, or who are otherwise culled ones from birth, typically find themselves outcasts from an early age, as the superstitions of those around them cause many culled ones to become the target of undeserved hostility and suspicion. Vilified and cast out at an early age, most culled ones quickly learn to take care of themselves. Those who become culled ones later in life often find that the communities which once welcomed him warmly now treat him distantly, or even with open malice.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Those who are culled ones from birth are lucky if even their family accepts them for who they are, and so develop a keen sense of self sufficiency, not relying on anything so fickle as the kindness of others. Those who become culled ones later in life are even less lucky, typically facing a sudden rejection from everyone that they care for. Either way, culled ones tend to be slow to trust others and to make new friends, but are usually fiercely loyal to anyone they know they can count on.\n\n{b}Alignment and Religion{/b}: As pariahs and outcasts, culled ones gravitate strongly towards chaotic alignments, placing little value on the community and focusing on their own survival. Some strive constantly to find acceptance, and these tend towards chaotic good, while others seek to take revenge for the cruel way the world has treated them, and these tend towards chaotic evil. Considering themselves unfairly cursed by their pseudo-undead state, few culled ones have any interest in religion.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Most culled ones turn to adventuring because they have few other options. Unwelcome in their communities, they typically take to travelling by themselves, rarely staying in any place for long. Because they travel alone, they must learn to defend themselves, and adventuring is merely a natural extension of this wandering. By contrast, some culled ones become adventurers in the hopes of becoming heroes and finding acceptance in their communities.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Those who are born as culled ones are typically named after the style of whichever parent keeps them. Those who become culled ones later in life typically keep their original names." compset="Template" summary="The offspring of a vampire and a mortal or a vampiric embrace improperly performed" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rNNWCullOn" name="Culled One" description="{i}The man before you is unnaturally pale, his skin a nearly-translucent shade, like pure porcelain. His features are strongly chiseled, and there is an unnatural aura about him: a sort of presence that is impossible to quantify. He is not only cold to the touch, but in fact the air around him seems to chill slightly in reaction to his presence.{/i}\n\nThe culled ones, as they call themselves, are a tragic race. They are composed of those trapped between life and death: the offspring of a vampire and a mortal, or the product of a vampiric embrace improperly performed. The culled ones are something more than mortal and something less than a vampire. Reviled by both, they find themselves with few options in society, and often strike out on their own, usually attempting to hide their pseudo-vampiric nature from those they meet.\n\n{b}Physical Traits{/b}: Physically, culled ones look similar to humans, except that they have much paler skin. Their eyes are almost universally an unnatural crystal-blue color. They are always cold to the touch, usually several degrees below room temperature.\n\nThough they do not require it to survive, most culled ones feel strong urges to drink blood. This blood addiction is very strong, and only the most iron-willed of culled ones is able to go for more than a few weeks without drinking at least a few drops of animal blood.\n\n{b}Society{/b}: Culled ones who are the union of a vampire and a mortal, or who are otherwise culled ones from birth, typically find themselves outcasts from an early age, as the superstitions of those around them cause many culled ones to become the target of undeserved hostility and suspicion. Vilified and cast out at an early age, most culled ones quickly learn to take care of themselves. Those who become culled ones later in life often find that the communities which once welcomed him warmly now treat him distantly, or even with open malice.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Those who are culled ones from birth are lucky if even their family accepts them for who they are, and so develop a keen sense of self sufficiency, not relying on anything so fickle as the kindness of others. Those who become culled ones later in life are even less lucky, typically facing a sudden rejection from everyone that they care for. Either way, culled ones tend to be slow to trust others and to make new friends, but are usually fiercely loyal to anyone they know they can count on.\n\n{b}Alignment and Religion{/b}: As pariahs and outcasts, culled ones gravitate strongly towards chaotic alignments, placing little value on the community and focusing on their own survival. Some strive constantly to find acceptance, and these tend towards chaotic good, while others seek to take revenge for the cruel way the world has treated them, and these tend towards chaotic evil. Considering themselves unfairly cursed by their pseudo-undead state, few culled ones have any interest in religion.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Most culled ones turn to adventuring because they have few other options. Unwelcome in their communities, they typically take to travelling by themselves, rarely staying in any place for long. Because they travel alone, they must learn to defend themselves, and adventuring is merely a natural extension of this wandering. By contrast, some culled ones become adventurers in the hopes of becoming heroes and finding acceptance in their communities.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Those who are born as culled ones are typically named after the style of whichever parent keeps them. Those who become culled ones later in life typically keep their original names." compset="Race" summary="The offspring of a vampire and a mortal or a vampiric embrace improperly performed">

  <thing id="tmNNWVpFrl" name="Vampire, Feral {i}Nachzehrer{/i}" description="{i}The creature before you is large, its eyes gleaming golden in the dim light. Its body is covered in coarse, matted black fur, and it walks on all fours; its huge, wicked claws making clacking sounds against the stone as it moves towards you. From its back extend a pair of leathery bat wings, each as long as you are tall, which give a lazy flap as it opens the hideous, many-fanged mouth set in its huge, bat-like head. Greyish-red saliva flecks fly everywhere from its maw as it leaps forward with an angry shriek, its claws outstretched for the kill.{/i}\n\nFeral vampires are a unique kind of vampire whose powers are dependent on how well-fed they are. The longer a feral vampire goes without feeding, the more powerful their bloodlust becomes, until eventually it begins to distort their physical nature, transforming them into a fearsome beast. The exact origins of the feral vampire are unclear, but the most common theory is that it is a curse which can be inflicted only by powerful spellcasters, or, depending on who one listens to, only by the gods. Whatever their origin, and whether or not their inner beast is metaphorical or an actual possessing fiend, feral vampires are dangerous creatures driven by little besides base bloodlust.\n\nA feral vampire&apos;s hunger can be sated only by large quantities of blood. Only the blood of sentient creatures will do, and only if the wounds that cause them are lethal. Feral vampires simply lack other vampires&apos; ability to feed without killing. Though it is only blood they are after, most feral vampires rip their victims to shreds, or sometimes consume them utterly, in a frenzy of violence and destruction. Unlike most vampires, feral vampires are not undead.\n\n{b}Creating a Feral Vampire{/b}: {i}Feral vampire{/i} is a template that can be added to any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid with 5 or more hit dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A feral vampire uses the base creature&apos;s stats and abilities except as noted here. The abilities of a feral vampire depend on how long it&apos;s been since it fed, as described below. A feral vampire gains the benefits listed under its hunger category, as well as the benefits of each lesser hunger category. These benefits do not stack unless their entry indicates otherwise." compset="Template" summary="A feral vampire&apos;s hunger can be sated only by large quantities of blood" uniqueness="unique">

When left unattended, zombies tend to mill about in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety.\n\nAlthough capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with no command other than to kill living creatures.

Zombies gain a number of additional HD. Zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).\n{b}Saves{/b}: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.\n{b}Defensive Abilities{/b}: Zombies lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR 5/slashing.\n{b}Speed{/b}: Winged zombies can still fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the zombie. Retain all other movement types.\n{b}Attacks{/b}: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the zombie&apos;s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size (see pages 301–302).\n{b}Special Attacks{/b}: A zombie retains none of the base creature&apos;s special attacks.\n{b}Abilities{/b}: Str +2, Dex –2. A zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10.\n{b}BAB{/b}: A zombie&apos;s base attack is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice.\n{b}Skills{/b}: A zombie has no skill ranks.\n{b}Feats{/b}: A zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat.\n{b}Special Qualities{/b}: A zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature.

  <thing id="cHelpNN1" name="Revenant Bloodletter" description="Powerful warriors who draw heavily on the life essence of others, revenant bloodletters are fearsome opponents in battle. Though they lack the formal training of a fighter, they more than make up for it with their undead immunities and their predatory ferocity. Whereas a fighter or a paladin might spend years training with a sword to learn how to fight with deadly efficiency, the revenant bloodletter taps into her inner predator, driving home killing blows by pure instinct. She can use the stolen life force of her victims to grant her supernatural resilience, making her nearly unstoppable on the field of battle.\n\nTrue masters of cruomancy, revenant bloodletters are nearly as imposing off the battlefield as on it. They can store truly massive amounts of life essence from the blood of their fallen victims, and by fully embracing their predatory existence, they master a wider variety of vampiric abilities than any other kind of cruomancer.\n\n{b}Making a Revenant Bloodletter{/b}\n\nA revenant bloodletter is primarily a melee fighter, much like a fighter or barbarian. Her bloodlust ability ensures that once first blood is spilled, she is a heavy hitter capable of dishing out extreme damage. Revenant bloodletters also gain a large number of bonus vampire feats, allowing them to make the most of their vampiric nature. Depending on her choice of vampiric abilities, a revenant bloodletter may also be able to fill other roles to a limited extent, with the ability to dominate or terrify foes.\n\n{b}Abilities{/b}: High Strength and Wisdom are important for a revenant bloodletter. Strength is crucial to nearly all up- front fighters, allowing them to hit and deal more damage. Being a revenant, the revenant bloodletter uses Wisdom for her bonus hit points, and so a high Wisdom will allow her to stay in the fight longer. Finally, the DCs for many of the revenant bloodletter&apos;s blood powers are Charisma-based.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Revenant bloodletters tend to be human, half-orc, or dwarven. These races tend to be the most interested in the feral, melee-intense aspects of the class, while elves, halflings, and gnomes tend typically find themselves more attracted to either the revenant ascetic or revenant occultist classes.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: As predators who must consume the blood of others to survive, few revenants of any kind are good, and revenant bloodletters spend much of their time and gain most of their strength from tapping into their feral, predatory nature. Because of this, revenant bloodletters are very rarely lawful in alignment, and very few revenant bloodletters are good, though some few do manage to access their inner beast without slipping into darkness themselves.\n\n{b}Starting Gold{/b}: 5d6x10\n{b}Hit Die{/b}: d12" compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">

Note: I set the "Maximum Blood Points" value into the "Maximum Power Level".  Then the script on this Helper Thing apply's it to the blood tracker.

This allows either the maximum from the class or racial hit dice to display.  It will also allow you an easy way to setup for the other classes.]]></comment>

  <thing id="cNNWRevBlo" name="Revenant Bloodletter" description="Powerful warriors who draw heavily on the life essence of others, revenant bloodletters are fearsome opponents in battle. Though they lack the formal training of a fighter, they more than make up for it with their undead immunities and their predatory ferocity. Whereas a fighter or a paladin might spend years training with a sword to learn how to fight with deadly efficiency, the revenant bloodletter taps into her inner predator, driving home killing blows by pure instinct. She can use the stolen life force of her victims to grant her supernatural resilience, making her nearly unstoppable on the field of battle.\n\nTrue masters of cruomancy, revenant bloodletters are nearly as imposing off the battlefield as on it. They can store truly massive amounts of life essence from the blood of their fallen victims, and by fully embracing their predatory existence, they master a wider variety of vampiric abilities than any other kind of cruomancer.\n\n{b}Making a Revenant Bloodletter{/b}\n\nA revenant bloodletter is primarily a melee fighter, much like a fighter or barbarian. Her bloodlust ability ensures that once first blood is spilled, she is a heavy hitter capable of dishing out extreme damage. Revenant bloodletters also gain a large number of bonus vampire feats, allowing them to make the most of their vampiric nature. Depending on her choice of vampiric abilities, a revenant bloodletter may also be able to fill other roles to a limited extent, with the ability to dominate or terrify foes.\n\n{b}Abilities{/b}: High Strength and Wisdom are important for a revenant bloodletter. Strength is crucial to nearly all up- front fighters, allowing them to hit and deal more damage. Being a revenant, the revenant bloodletter uses Wisdom for her bonus hit points, and so a high Wisdom will allow her to stay in the fight longer. Finally, the DCs for many of the revenant bloodletter&apos;s blood powers are Charisma-based.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Revenant bloodletters tend to be human, half-orc, or dwarven. These races tend to be the most interested in the feral, melee-intense aspects of the class, while elves, halflings, and gnomes tend typically find themselves more attracted to either the revenant ascetic or revenant occultist classes.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: As predators who must consume the blood of others to survive, few revenants of any kind are good, and revenant bloodletters spend much of their time and gain most of their strength from tapping into their feral, predatory nature. Because of this, revenant bloodletters are very rarely lawful in alignment, and very few revenant bloodletters are good, though some few do manage to access their inner beast without slipping into darkness themselves.\n\n{b}Starting Gold{/b}: 5d6x10\n{b}Hit Die{/b}: d12" compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

As a standard action, the revenant\ninfiltrator can make a single melee attack against a creature. If the attack hits, it deals damage as normal, and the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the revenant infiltrator’s class level + the revenant infiltrator’s Intelligence modifier) or be paralyzed. The target may make a new saving\nthrow each round as a full-round action to end the effect, but all saving throws after the first suffer a -4 penalty. Even if the target is unable to succeed on any saving throws, the effect ends automatically after 5 minutes. If the attack misses, the use of the ability is wasted. Creatures that are not living (such\nas constructs or undead), or are immune to critical hits or precision-based damage, are immune to this ability.\n\nThe revenant infiltrator can use this ability once per day at 1st level.

  <thing id="cHelpNN3" name="Revenant Occultist" description="Revenant occultists care about only one thing: getting power, and lots of it. Not satisfied with simply mastering arcane spells, revenant occultists also delve deep into their vampiric powers, using their cruomancy to supplement their more traditional spellcasting.\n\nA revenant occultist&apos;s magic comes from her blood, much like a sorcerer&apos;s, but because of the revenant occultist&apos;s close ties to blood and blood magic, she is able to evenbetter manipulate the arcane potential coursing through her blackened, withered veins. The most powerful revenant occultists find almost nothing impossible to do, and it is rumored that true masters of the art are even capable of replenishing their spells without resting.\n\n{b}Making a Revenant Occultist{/b}\n\nA revenant occultist is the spellcaster of the party, and can handle anything from magical artillery to support to battlefield control. Her blood powers supplement her spellcasting ability, allowing her to cover any gaps in her spells known. Her high Charisma and Intelligence makes her an excellent choice for party leader.\n\n{b}Abilities{/b}: A revenant occultist&apos;s most important ability score is Charisma. Charisma determines the save DCs for her spells and blood powers. Dexterity can help her avoid being hit in combat. Finally, as a Revenant, a revenant occultist derives her bonus hit points from her Wisdom score.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Revenant occultists tend to be human, elven, or gnomish. Though elves and gnomes are more accustomed to wizardry than sorcery, the revenant occultist&apos;s scholarly approach to their inherent magic is easy enough for them to understand. Half-orcs and dwarves are not typically magically inclined in life, and death does not change this in more than a handful of them.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Like all revenants, revenant occultists require the blood of the living to continue their unnatural existence, and many of them come to view living creatures as little more than cattle. For this reason very few revenant occultists are of good alignment, and most are evil. A revenant occultist is equally likely to tend towards a chaotic or evil alignment.\n\n{b}Starting Gold{/b}: 2d6x10\n{b}Hit Die{/b}: d6" compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">

Not satisfied with simply mastering arcane spells, revenant occultists also delve deep into their vampiric powers, using their cruomancy to supplement their more traditional spellcasting.\n\nA revenant occultist&apos;s magic comes from her blood, much like a sorcerer&apos;s, but because of the revenant occultist&apos;s close ties to blood and blood magic, she is able to evenbetter manipulate the arcane potential coursing through her blackened, withered veins. The most powerful revenant occultists find almost nothing impossible to do, and it is rumored that true masters of the art are even capable of replenishing their spells without resting.\n\n{b}Making a Revenant Occultist{/b}\n\nA revenant occultist is the spellcaster of the party, and can handle anything from magical artillery to support to battlefield control. Her blood powers supplement her spellcasting ability, allowing her to cover any gaps in her spells known. Her high Charisma and Intelligence makes her an excellent choice for party leader.\n\n{b}Abilities{/b}: A revenant occultist&apos;s most important ability score is Charisma. Charisma determines the save DCs for her spells and blood powers. Dexterity can help her avoid being hit in combat. Finally, as a Revenant, a revenant occultist derives her bonus hit points from her Wisdom score.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Revenant occultists tend to be human, elven, or gnomish. Though elves and gnomes are more accustomed to wizardry than sorcery, the revenant occultist&apos;s scholarly approach to their inherent magic is easy enough for them to understand. Half-orcs and dwarves are not typically magically inclined in life, and death does not change this in more than a handful of them.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Like all revenants, revenant occultists require the blood of the living to continue their unnatural existence, and many of them come to view living creatures as little more than cattle. For this reason very few revenant occultists are of good alignment, and most are evil. A revenant occultist is equally likely to tend towards a chaotic or evil alignment.\n\n{b}Starting Gold{/b}: 2d6x10\n{b}Hit Die{/b}: d6" compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

This is a free action made as part of casting the spell, and doing so does not increase the level of the spell, nor does it increase the casting time for the spell.

At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, the revenant occultist is able to spend an additional 2 blood points to add another effective spell level in metamagic to a spell she is casting (for example, at 7th level she could spend 2 blood points to apply the Still Spell feat, or she could spend 4 blood points to apply both Still Spell and Silent Spell, or she could spend 4 blood points to apply Empower Spell).

  <thing id="cHelpNN4" name="Sanguine Aspirant" description="The sanguine aspirant seeks a unique path to unlocking the powers of vampirism and blood. Though most living creatures are singularly poor at the art of cruomancy, there exists a certain series of ritual tests, known as the Sanguine Path, which, through hard work and dedication, allow an aspirant to unlock the true powers of the blood without giving up his life, effectively creating a living vampire. Those who prove capable enough to walk the steps of the Sanguine Path quickly become powerful, immortal beings much like the vampires that they emulate, though they retain their human nature and living state. The most powerful sanguine aspirants rest easy knowing that even if they are slain by treachery or violence, they will rise again as a powerful vampire to continue their eternal existence.\n\n{b}Becoming a Sanguine Aspirant{/b}\n\nAnyone who wants to become a sanguine aspirant must first devote himself to studying the Sanguine Path. To this end, he must train himself in the study of several different schools of knowledge, including religion, history, and arcana. Though it isn&apos;t necessary for a sanguine aspirant to be an expert in all three of these fields, the more he knows in these three fields the better able he will be to determine the necessary steps along the Sanguine Path. The sanguine aspirant can come from any walk of life, his studies in the occult and discovery of the Sanguine Path being the only constraint. Spellcasters, however, typically find the class too much of a distraction from their magical studies.\n\nAt each successive level in the class, the sanguine aspirant will have to discover a specific ritual prerequisite and then perform it. The nature of the ritual can be discovered either through interaction with NPCs, or by making a successful Knowledge check. The information for these prerequisites, including the nature of the rituals and the kind and DC of the checks to discover this information can be found in Appendix: Steps of the Sanguine Path at the end of this book. It is highly recommended that only GMs peruse this sidebar, as knowledge of the steps in the path will limit the flavor and fun of the prestige class.\n\n{b}Entry Requirements{/b}\n\n{b}Skills{/b}: 5 ranks in any two of Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion)\n{b}Feats{/b}: Novice cruomancer\n{b}Special{/b}: The character must discover the first step of the Sanguine Path and perform it. Additionally, the sanguine aspirant prestige class is special in that it has a separate entry requirement for each level of the class. These requirements all involve discovering and performing the next step of the Sanguine Path. GMs should see Appendix: Steps of the Sanguine Path, for more information on the Sanguine Path.\n\n{b}Class Features{/b}\n\n{b}Hit Dice{/b}: d8\n{b}Skills{/b}: Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion), Lingusitics, Perception, Use Magic Device\n{b}Weapon and Armor Proficiencies{/b}: A sanguine aspirant gains no new proficiencies with any kind of weapons, armor, or shields." compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cNNWSanAsp" name="Sanguine Aspirant" description="The sanguine aspirant seeks a unique path to unlocking the powers of vampirism and blood. Though most living creatures are singularly poor at the art of cruomancy, there exists a certain series of ritual tests, known as the Sanguine Path, which, through hard work and dedication, allow an aspirant to unlock the true powers of the blood without giving up his life, effectively creating a living vampire. Those who prove capable enough to walk the steps of the Sanguine Path quickly become powerful, immortal beings much like the vampires that they emulate, though they retain their human nature and living state. The most powerful sanguine aspirants rest easy knowing that even if they are slain by treachery or violence, they will rise again as a powerful vampire to continue their eternal existence.\n\n{b}Becoming a Sanguine Aspirant{/b}\n\nAnyone who wants to become a sanguine aspirant must first devote himself to studying the Sanguine Path. To this end, he must train himself in the study of several different schools of knowledge, including religion, history, and arcana. Though it isn&apos;t necessary for a sanguine aspirant to be an expert in all three of these fields, the more he knows in these three fields the better able he will be to determine the necessary steps along the Sanguine Path. The sanguine aspirant can come from any walk of life, his studies in the occult and discovery of the Sanguine Path being the only constraint. Spellcasters, however, typically find the class too much of a distraction from their magical studies.\n\nAt each successive level in the class, the sanguine aspirant will have to discover a specific ritual prerequisite and then perform it. The nature of the ritual can be discovered either through interaction with NPCs, or by making a successful Knowledge check. The information for these prerequisites, including the nature of the rituals and the kind and DC of the checks to discover this information can be found in Appendix: Steps of the Sanguine Path at the end of this book. It is highly recommended that only GMs peruse this sidebar, as knowledge of the steps in the path will limit the flavor and fun of the prestige class.\n\n{b}Entry Requirements{/b}\n\n{b}Skills{/b}: 5 ranks in any two of Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion)\n{b}Feats{/b}: Novice cruomancer\n{b}Special{/b}: The character must discover the first step of the Sanguine Path and perform it. Additionally, the sanguine aspirant prestige class is special in that it has a separate entry requirement for each level of the class. These requirements all involve discovering and performing the next step of the Sanguine Path. GMs should see Appendix: Steps of the Sanguine Path, for more information on the Sanguine Path.\n\n{b}Class Features{/b}\n\n{b}Hit Dice{/b}: d8\n{b}Skills{/b}: Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion), Lingusitics, Perception, Use Magic Device\n{b}Weapon and Armor Proficiencies{/b}: A sanguine aspirant gains no new proficiencies with any kind of weapons, armor, or shields." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

Though they are fully undead, revenants remain far closer to their humanity than other kinds of undead creatures, and most can actually masquerade as members of the living world. Unlike most other vampires, revenants need blood to continue their existence, and will eventually die without it. They also have an innate ability to tap into cruomancy, a specialized form of magic which uses stolen life essence carried in the blood of a revenant&apos;s victims to perform impressive supernatural feats.\n\n{b}Creating a Revenant{/b}: &quot;Revenant&quot; is a template which can be applied to any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A revenant uses the base creature&apos;s stats and abilities except as noted here.\n\n{b}Becoming a Revenant{/b}: It is assumed that most players who want to play revenant characters will choose to start the game as a revenant during character creation, in which case it&apos;s not of immediate concern exactly how the character became a revenant prior to the beginning of the game. That said, players in the middle of existing campaigns may find, for a number of reasons, that they would suddenly like for their existing character to become a revenant (such as because they only just acquired this book, for example). In an ideal world, such players could simply make this desire known to their GM, who could write in an encounter with a vampire that could serve as an opportunity for interested players to be &quot;turned&quot; and have their characters become revenants. But sometimes that&apos;s not an option, for whatever reason, and other times it will simply feel contrived.\n\nWith GM permission, a character could also become a revenant by performing a special ritual, much in the same way that a character can become a lich by performing a ritual and creating a phylactery. It requires a DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check to successfully identify the nature of this ritual, or to learn about it through research in a library or other place of accumulated knowledge. The ritual itself requires an hour to perform, and requires 500 gp in rare incense, ointments, and ritual objects. At the end of the ritual, the would-be revenant must wound himself (typically be cutting his wrist with a ritually anointed dagger) and bleed into a special ceremonial bowl for an extended period of time. During this time, the character suffers 1 point of damage per round, which can be stopped at any time by a successful Heal check (DC 15). If the character reaches 0 hit points, then at the beginning of his turn each round, when he takes damage from the bleeding, he may make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check succeeds, the bleeding stops, and the character immediately becomes a revenant. The character can attempt this check once per round until he either succeeds, the bleeding is stopped, or he dies." compset="Race">

A specific deity&apos;s prayer book or holy book could suffice, as could a major image made to appear as the holy symbol.

The more exclusive membership is (especially if it is based on criteria other than paying membership dues), the more likely it is to apply. Similarly, the more personal the nature of the club is, and the less that the activities that take place there have to do with work or business of any kind, the more likely it is to apply. The headquarters of a cult with elaborate initiation rituals would certainly apply, whereas the office of the local banker&apos;s guild would be less likely to.\n\nAbandoned homes, including ancient and forgotten temples and tombs, do not apply, even though they may technically be &quot;homes&quot; or &quot;private places.&quot;\n\nIn the case of buildings with a large number of residents, such as castles and keeps, especially those with multiple servants or an entire servants&apos; quarters, the building itself is not a &quot;private place&quot; for the purposes of this ability, but any individual personal quarters within the building would be." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Has extreme difficulty entering a home.
