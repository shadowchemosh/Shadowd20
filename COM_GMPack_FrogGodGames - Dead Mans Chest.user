      July 12, 2012 - Tim Shadow
      -Renamed to PFRPG_Dead_Mans_Chest.user as ' can freak out MAC versions of Hero Lab. Or at least I am not taking the chance as I have seen to many simple characters cause MAC version to crash or strange results.
      -Merged into v1.9.
      -Added History notes section.
      -Moved the source tags over to the .1st file.]]></info_history>

  <thing id="ruBreathTa" name="Breath Taker" description="A breath taker is an aquatic undead creature that robs the breath from its victim. In life they were evil thieves who drowned at sea, pirates who took valuable goods at will from others that plied the waves. Now, in unlife, they seek out and steal that which was first taken from them-the ability to breathe.\n\nA breath taker has two primary attack modes. Either it uses its long, seaweed-encrusted fingernails against an enemy, or its dreaded ability the steal the very breath from its victim's lungs. The breath taker's rotted chest visibly expands as it draws this fresh air into itself." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rauBTkStlA" name="Steal Air" description="A breath taker can cause a ghostly, incorporeal hand with a reach of 10 feet to emerge from its own hand. If it makes a successful incorporeal touch attack, the breath taker's hand plunges into the chest of its victim, who must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become fatigued as he begins to suffocate. On a successful save, the hand is harmlessly expelled. The breath taker must make a touch attack each round as a move action to maintain the connection. As long as the breath taker maintains the connection, the victim must continue to make a Fortitude save each round to expel the hand. On the second failed save, the victim falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the victim falls to -1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the victim dies. Each round, the victim can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but each time a victim fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further toward suffocation. As this happens, the breath taker's rotted chest visibly expands as it draws the victim's air into itself. To escape the touch, the victim must either make a successful Fortitude save and move (or be carried) out of the breath taker's reach, or the breath taker must be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based." compset="RaceSpec">
