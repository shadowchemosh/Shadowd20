You may spend a prepared conjuration (teleportation) spell to fuel this ability, or use a spell slot to fuel it if you are a spontaneous spellcaster who knows a conjuration (teleportation) spell. You may use this ability once per level of the spell or spell slot spent to fuel it. You may never have more uses of apportation available at once than half your hit dice, and you lose one use of apportation for each hour that passes without using it.\n\nApportation is a standard action and acts as a dimension door, with a caster level equal to half your hit dice and a maximum range of\n5 feet per hit die." compset="Feat" summary="You can force the power of teleportation spells to fuel a natural teleportation ability." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fSGAugTlpt" name="Augment Teleportation" description="Your mastery of teleportation allows you to take more material, from farther away, and rearrange where it is when you arrive.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Spell Focus (conjuration), able to cast a conjuration (teleportation) spell.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast a conjuration (teleportation) spell, you can take more material through the teleportation that normal, affect creatures further away than normal, and reposition teleported creature’s positions relative to you. When determining how much material can be teleported, each creature you teleport (including yourself) may affect additional touched material. This material cannot exceed the heavy load for a creature with a Strength score equal to your caster level. \n\nFor example, if a 15th level wizard with Augment Teleport casts dimension door, in addition to his own gear (up to his maximum load) and up to 5 willing Medium creatures touched, the wizard and each of his 5 “passengers” can bring up to 200 lbs. of additional touched material (the heavy load for a 15 Strength). Additional material of this kind can include living creatures, but such characters do not also gain the ability to\nbring excess material. Several teleport targets may all touch a single larger object, to allow them to bring items using their combined\nadditional weight allowance.\n\nAdditionally, if the conjuration (teleportation) spell normally requires you to touch creatures for them to be affected, you may include willing creatures within 15 feet of you as if you were touching them. When you arrive at the spell’s destination, you may place creatures that teleported with you in different positions, as long as all remain within 15 feet of you. \n\nIf any of the creatures teleported are falling, you may reduce or eliminate their rate of falling to whatever degree you wish. You may also cause creatures to gain a falling speed so that when they arrive at the teleportation’s destination, they impact as if they’d fallen a maximum of 10 feet per level of the teleportation spell used." compset="Feat" summary="Your mastery of teleportation allows you to take more material, from farther away, and rearrange where it is when you arrive." uniqueness="useronce">

You may choose which effect to benefit from at the beginning of each of your rounds. Alternatively you may gain the benefits of the ethereal jaunt spell after you are affected by a conjuration (teleportation) spell, but in this case the benefits last for just 1 round." compset="Feat" summary="You retain some of the aspects of etherealness after you teleport." uniqueness="useronce">

Anyone also affected by the teleportation is aware of this “long moment” prior to teleporting and may choose not to be affected by the spell if they prefer. During the 1-round between teleporting and arriving, you and everyone in the teleport are treated as if they were in an extradimensional space (similar to those used by bags of holding). Only spells and\neffects that could target or affect an item inside a bag of holding on the ethereal plane can target or effect you during the long moment of a slow teleportation.\n\nDuring the 1-round long moment creatures teleporting with you may do anything they could normally do in 1 round, as long as it does not involve moving or affecting any creature other than themselves. A cleric could cast a cure spell on herself, for example, but not on another creature traveling with the teleport effect. \n\nDuring this 1-round long moment, you can also cast any divination (scrying) spell you have available on the arrival point of your teleportation, as if that location was on the same plane, its location obvious, and its distance no more than 50 feet away. Such scry spells target the actuall\ndestination of your teleportation, rather than your planned destination, in those cases where the two are different. You may share any information you gain through this scrying spell with others involved in the teleportation. If you also have the Augment Teleportation feat, you\nmay choose how to position creatures at the end of your teleport after learning anything you can from any scrying spell you cast." compset="Feat" summary="Rather than travel instantly from place to place, you can take a leisurely long moment before arrival." uniqueness="useronce">

Because of the imprecise nature of applying spell effects to yourself as a result of teleportation, you must also spend a second spell slot or sacrifice a second prepare spell.
