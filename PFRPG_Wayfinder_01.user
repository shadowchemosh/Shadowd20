The caster must choose which sort of energy to make the circle from at the moment of casting and once made cannot change this decision. Any creature passing through the circle develops a flickering corona, the color of which corresponds to the energy type of the circle (acid=black, cold=white, electricity=blue, fire=red, sonic=green). The creature gains energy resistance 10 to that energy type for one minute, until it deals damage with a melee attack, or it touches ground (whichever comes first). If the creature makes a successful melee attack while protected with this aura it deals an extra 1d6 points of energy damage to its opponent.\n\nCreatures may travel through this circle multiple times, regaining the energy aura with each trip. If a mounted creature passes through the circle both the mount and the rider gain the energy aura and continue to share its effects if one of them loses the aura but remains in contact with the other.\n\nAnimals and similar creatures only fly through this circle if specifically trained to do so (see sidebar)." compset="Spell">

During this time of chaos a new tradition was formed, a blending of traditional pathfinding and the gnomish affinity for shadow and illusion magic. These were the first of the shadow scouts.\n\nShadow scouts are pathfinders in the truest sense, they are scouts and rangers but they lean heavily on magic, stealth, and deception in addition to more mundane skills. The tradition of the shadow scout is carried on in all enclaves, including among the svirfneblin in the Darklands.

  <thing id="spW1LaunP2" name="Launching Perch" description="This spell enables one creature no larger than yourself to balance on a glove covering your forearm and briefly gain the ability to make a devastating flying charge once it leaps off. While the target may take no action while perched on your arm in this way, it is effectively weightless from your perspective and has no impact on your encumbrance or speed. However, this does fully engage your arm, meaning you cannot use it for any other purpose. The glove, similar in appearance to what falconers wear when taking raptors hunting, provides extraordinary stability to the target, allowing it to maintain its balance under even the most extreme conditions unless it chooses to step off or you stop concentrating on the spell.\n\nWhen the target leaves your arm it gains the ability to fly for one round at three times its base land speed or twice its fly speed (whichever is greater). During that round, the creature may also chose to make a special flying charge. This allows it to make a full attack and grants it an additional +2 bonus on its attack rolls. In addition, any successful attack it makes as part of this charge automatically scores a critical threat (but the target must still make a confirmation roll as normal)." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="spW1PlumL4" name="Plumage Lure" description="This spell causes the feathers of a willing creature with a fly speed to emit pulses of light that other specific sorts of creatures find almost irresistibly intriguing. The caster must designate a particular type or subtype of creature as susceptible to these pulses at the time of casting. Creatures normally immune to mind-affecting effects, or those who lack the ability to see, are not vulnerable to this spell. Any eligible creature belonging to the category established by the caster that comes within 30 feet of the target and has a clear line of sight must make a Will saving throw to avoid becoming fascinated. Fascinated creatures follow the target if it moves away and remain under its influence so long as they can continue to see it and stay within 90 feet of it.\n\nAnimals and similar creatures only stay within sight of those they have fascinated if specifically trained to do so (see sidebar)." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="spW1PlunH1" name="Plunging Hood" description="This spell creates a black leather mask around the target&#146;s head that renders it both blind and deaf until removed. Though vaguely similar to the hood falconers use to make birds of prey more docile, this mask perfectly fits the contours of the target&#146;s head but has neither eye nor ear holes. Any creature (whether the target or another) with hands or similar manipulative limbs can remove the mask as a standard action, but those lacking them must also succeed in Dexterity check (DC 15) in order to do so.\n\nIf cast on a creature with multiple heads the caster must decide on which head the mask appears. If cast on a creature with eyes, ears, or similar sensory organs on any part of its body except its head (or on a creature without a head), the mask tears and falls to pieces without actually affecting the target.\n\nThe mask renders the target immune to all fear effects (including those already affecting it when this spell is cast) until it is removed. Once taken off the mask loses this ability, even if placed back on the target again, but it still makes the target blind and deaf while worn." compset="Spell">
