  <thing id="manFGBind" name="Bind" description="As a melee attack, you may attempt to gain control of your opponent&apos;s weapon. Make a combat maneuver check against your opponent&apos;s combat maneuver defense, including all appropriate modifiers. If you succeed on your check, you bind his weapon. If you fail to meet or exceed your opponent&apos;s CMD, you fail to bind his weapon.\n\nWhile bound, you and your opponent may not use the bound weapons and do not threaten any squares with these weapons. On his turn, the opponent may attempt to free his weapon with combat maneuver check of his own, or he can drop it as a free action. If the opponent does not free or drop his weapon, he may not move out of your threat range.\n\nWhile binding your opponent, you suffer the same limitations, except that you may end the bind as a free action. If you attempt to disarm your opponent or sunder the bound weapon, you do not provoke an attack of opportunity, and you receive a +4 bonus to the combat maneuver check and to the damage of the sunder attempt.\n\nYou can only bind the weapon of an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you, and attempting to bind a foe while unarmed imposes a -4 penalty on the attack." compset="ManType">
