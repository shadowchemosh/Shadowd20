  <thing id="ioMyAmbros" name="Ambrosia" description="This divine food comes in many forms, from a light and airy honeyed cake to a deep and rich chocolate, but any mythic creature that eats it finds itself restored and replenished. Eating this food takes 1 minute, at the end of which the mythic creature has all the uses of its mythic power restored. If a nonmythic creature consumes ambrosia, it is subject to {i}neutralize poison, remove curse,{/i} and {i}remove disease{/i}, each at caster level 10th. A mythic creature can choose to gain this effect instead of regaining mythic power." compset="Wondrous" stacking="merge">

The book grants a +5 bonus on any Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a creature. Additionally, up to three times per day the book can be used to cast {i}hideous laughter{/i} (Will DC 13 negates). Finally, by expending a use of mythic power, the book&apos;s reader can make a brutal verbal tirade mocking a creature. The target creature is enraged per the {i}rage{/i} spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably as per {i}hideous laughter {/i}(Will DC 14 negates either effect). The book contains only one perfect joke for any given creature, so attempting to use the book on a creature a second time yields no effect." compset="Wondrous">

Three times per day, the wearer can call upon the power of these bracers as a swift action to gain a +4 sacred bonus to Strength for 1 round.

By expending one use of mythic power, the wielder of this bow can make a single attack and compare the result against every enemy within 60 feet. The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it to all foes hit by the attack.

When two individuals each wear a single bracer (which still takes up both of wrist slots), the wearers each gain a +2 shield bonus to AC as long as they remain within 100 feet of one another. By expending a use of mythic power as a swift action, the wearer of one of the bracers can teleport up to 100 feet and appear in any space adjacent to the other wearer. The wearer acts normally for the remainder of his turn, then immediately teleports back to his original space once his turn ends. Effects that prevent dimensional travel either from the wearer&apos;s space or destination can block this travel, but do not prevent the wearer&apos;s return." compset="Wondrous">

When drawn over the shoulders, with the hood up, the wearer seems to blend in with his surroundings, gaining a +5 bonus on Stealth checks and on Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. The cloak also renders the wearer immune to the scent ability. If the wearer expends a use of mythic power, the cloak turns her invisible for 1 hour, as {i}greater invisibility{/i}. This effect ends if the wearer makes an attack (as per {i}invisibility{/i}), but remains for 1 minute after the attack is made. A character made invisible by this cloak can&apos;t be seen with {i}see invisibility{/i} or {i}true seeing{/i}, and invisibility purge or other similar effects do not end the effect." compset="Wondrous">

Sadly, ale poured from the tankard rather than quaffed quickly loses it virtue and flavor, becoming the most common sort of swill within mere minutes. The tankard prevents most of the ill-\neffects of excessive drink, such as hangover and blackouts, for as long as it remains in its owner&apos;s possession. It also provides a +4 bonus on saves against poison. Once per day, by drinking the contents of the tankard as a move action and voicing a toast, the imbiber gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, while taking a -2 penalty on Dexterity- and Intelligence-based ability checks and skill checks. These effects last for 10 minutes. Note that if the tankard is empty, it must be filled as standard action prior to drinking. By expending one use of mythic power while drinking, the imbiber can increase the bonuses to +4, the penalties to -4, and the duration of the tankard&apos;s effects to 1 hour." compset="Wondrous">

This additional attack is made using the same attack bonus as the first, though range penalties apply based on the total distance the dagger flies.

The wearer and any allies within 30 feet are healed for 1d6 + his mythic tier points of damage at the start of each of his turns as long as the light persists." compset="Wondrous">
