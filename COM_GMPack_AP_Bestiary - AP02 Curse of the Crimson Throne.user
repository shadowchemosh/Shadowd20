  <thing id="rURaktavar" name="Raktavarna" description="All at once, this mundane sword begins to twitch and writhe, as if with a life of its own. Gold embellishments vanish, steel melts, and evaporates in a cloud of fragrant incense as the weapon reshapes itself into an enormous hooded serpent, fierce horns protruding above glowing red eyes.\n\nRakshasas&apos; love of gold is timeless. Something about the way the blood of a fresh sacrifice clings to its lustrous surface drives rakshasas to distraction, and some sages claim the fiends invented coins as a means of controlling men&apos;s souls. Whether this is true or not, rakshasas definitely invented some of the most sinister and creative uses for them. Raktavarnas are one such diabolic creation. All smoke, blood, and gold, these wretched things are the souls of once-regal giant serpents mingled with the heart&apos;s blood of a conquered prince or great warrior. The ceremony for creating a raktavarna is complex, and the confluence of desecrated incense and heart-ripping sacrifice over a bed of coins spent on warfare produces a twisted monster whose only will is to serve its rakshasa master as eyes, ears, and fangs. These terrors drift through men&apos;s lives, passing from hand to hand as weapons or strange coins from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and given to greater men as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas gain entry into corridors of power throughout Golarion, and what they see, their foul masters know.\n\nEcology\n\nA raktavarna is 4 feet long in its snake form, and its powerful body weighs more than 100 pounds. Spirits of dead snakes mingled with men&apos;s shades, raktavarnas are as immortal as their deathless masters. They require no food, though they crave the taste of hot blood. The creatures never sleep and remain constantly alert, watching, ever ready to do their dark masters&apos; bidding. Capable of remaining dormant in their object form for centuries, some raktavarnas linger in the vaults of powerful kings and queens, while others use their suggestion on the weak to move from spy to unwitting spy, collecting information for the rakshasa that spawned them. Only rarely do raktavarnas reveal their natural form, and then only to torment their victims, when such knowledge comes far too late to be useful.\n\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nRaktavarnas are slaves. They obey their masters, though some remember enough of their former lives, as great snakes slithering through the jungle or rulers of men, to hate what they have become. Still, the blood commands them, and they cannot stray too far from their masters&apos; will. They have no sense of social order beyond their abject subjugation to the fiends who wrought them. More vicious specimens take on the forms of sentient magic items and enjoy lording their power over the mortals who carry them, forcing them into unnecessarily brutal acts such as self-mutilation or killing loved ones.\n\nTreasure\n\nRaktavarnas secretly lust for gold just as their masters do. If a raktavarna can collect 1000 gold pieces of its own, it is freed from its master&apos;s influence forever. Only one piece of gold may be collected from a given person without alerting its master, however, and the raktavarna cannot use its spell-like abilities to compel this gift. Raktavarnas jealously hide and guard their hoards, since if the gold is stolen they must begin afresh. Any other treasure a raktavarna collects during the course of its duties is immediately turned over to its master to allay suspicion and keep the rakshasa from noticing the theft. As a result, raktavarnas rarely carry any gear. Often, the raktavarna itself can function as treasure for an unsuspecting carrier. In the form of a weapon, a raktavarna can shed an aura of magic, and while a spell like identify won&apos;t reveal any particular powers, the raktavarna can contact its handler via telepathy. The outsider uses this contact to Bluff its new &#147;owner,&#148; pretending to be an intelligent weapon. Of course, this deception lasts only as long as the owner suits the raktavarna&apos;s particular plans.\n\nThe Tiger and the Coin\n\nMost raktavarnas take the form of snakes, but not all. Perhaps the most famous of all stories involving a raktavarna features an especially powerful creature made using the soul of a majestic tiger instead of a snake. This fiend, called Sharah, took the form of a gold coin covered in Vudran runes. When crusaders from Taldor raided one of its master&apos;s chief holdings, Sharah secreted itself in the treasury, where it was picked up by one of the raiders. From there, it moved slowly up the chain of command, whispering seditious thoughts in the ears of its bearers and fomenting rebellion within the crusaders&apos; ranks, until finally it reached their leader. There its quiet urgings drove the warlord to madness, and in the order&apos;s final hours, as the leader stood blood-spattered and desolate among the remains of his loyal soldiers, the raktavarna revealed itself and completed its master&apos;s vengeance. As a result, to this day, Taldoran merchants will sometimes hang Vudran coins from the roofs of their stalls, a tribute to keep rakshasas from taking an interest in their dealings.\n\nCreation\n\nTo create a raktavarna, a rakshasa must cut the heart from the chest of a prince, princess, or warlord. He must then immediately feed the still-beating organ to a snake-the traditional snake being the deadly emperor cobra. The snake itself is then ritually slaughtered and its blood drained into a gold brazier, which is used to burn exotic incense gathered from secret ledges in the Outer Rifts, where demons caper and devil-ghosts howl-this incense can be purchased in certain hidden markets for 5,000 gp. The rakshasa must then cast suggestion, lesser geas, and lesser planar binding upon the burning brazier, and the new raktavarna solidifies from the oily black smoke to serve its new master. At this point, the rakshasa must spend 500 XP to bind the raktavarna to itself, otherwise the creature dies as soon as it is born." compset="Race" summary="Raktavarna">

  <thing id="rUDreamSpi" name="Spider, Dream" description="This child-sized spider&apos;s blue-and-yellow-striped abdomen shimmers as it scuttles along its gossamer web. A drop of thick purple venom drips from its mandibles.\n\nNative to the fecund jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, dream spiders are among the many wondrous and terrifying creatures to stalk the thick tropical forests of Garund. Their name among the people native to the region, Jalkara Kal, is the name of the mythic Prince of Dreams revered by many tribes of river people. The Sutra of the Ancients tells of Jalkara Kal&apos;s transformation into a spider after Mevenga the Leopard, Prince of Ravages, convinced the All-King that Jalkara was a traitor. The All-King later learned of Mevenga&apos;s treachery, but had employed powers so rancorous against Jalkara that the punitive transformation could never be undone. The best the All-King could do was to return Jalkara&apos;s power over dreams and visions to him in his new arachnid form. The dream spiders are Jalkara&apos;s brood, and depending on which tribe you ask, they have menaced or blessed the peoples of the jungle since time immemorial. The power of their venom, to gift the bitten with visions, is widely valued, but many fear the poisonous boon, believing the visions to be of some future doom. Some tribes hunt the Jalkara Kal viciously, driving the creatures from their lands. Foreigners find the narcotic bliss that accompanies a dream spider&apos;s bite irresistible, and trappers both native and foreign now sell the strange monsters for three times their weight in gold to traders who bring the venomous beasts to Cheliax, Absalom, Varisia, and other cosmopolitan and decadent ports of call. Some are even rumored to spin their iridescent webs, which carry a similar poison, into an intoxicating silk cloth.\n\nDream spiders lurk in dark places. In the jungles they spin their webs in the thick branches of the canopy above, skulk under mossy growths, or hide among fungal shelves jutting from the giant trees of the Mwangi. Thanks to the widespread and often illegal trade of Jalkara Kal, a number of these venomous beasts also infest many of Golarion&apos;s largest cities. There they hide on rafter beams, in attic corners, under moldy blankets in cellars, up unused chimneys, in the cabinets of abandoned kitchens, and like environs.\n\nDream spiders lay egg in lightless places and prefer to plant their brood in books above all. Libraries are often infested with dream spiders, and some sages claim great tales of history are the Jalkara Kal&apos;s favorite nest. The fact that the Prince of Dreams is also known as the Father of History either lends credence to the sages&apos; tales, or perhaps inspires them to invent stories of spider-spewing tomes of past lore. More practical scholars, however, are quick to point out that the pages of books are easily chewed into the paste that constitutes the spider&apos;s nesting material. Dream spiders grow very quickly, as if time cannot hold them back from whatever dire and poisonous ambitions they harbor.\n\nTreasure\n\nDream spiders are a treasure unto themselves. A live specimen is worth 50 gp, while a typical egg cluster is worth 100 gp (young dream spiders are difficult to raise in captivity, though). Dream spider webbing is worth 50 gp per nest, although care must be taken in handling the stuff. Silk spun from dream spider webs is particularly valued in the crafting of clothing intended to bear illusion magic.\n\nThe primary value of a dream spider, though, is to an alchemist who has mastered the craft of brewing shiver from dream spider venom. A single dose of shiver is worth 10 gp, although actual street value can sometimes exceed five times that amount in areas where drug trades are tightly controlled or illegal. In Korvosa, a dose of shiver typically sells for 25 gp-enough that a life of petty theft can just barely keep an addict in ready supply.\n\nVariants\n\nSeveral sub-species of Jalkara Kal are known to exist-the specimen described above is merely the most populous breed, and the easiest to catch.\n\nPerhaps the next most common variant is the deatheye dancer. These mottled black and purple dream spiders are usually bulkier than the common breed, and their fangs are noticeably larger as well (bite damage 1d6). The bite of a death-eye dancer also causes a victim to shuffle and spasm wildly, almost as if dancing-this venom deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage in addition to the normal Wisdom damage.\n\nRarer are the much larger and more dangerous nightmare spiders-Medium-sized dream spiders with black and red markings whose venom causes three times the amount of Wisdom damage on the initial save and paralysis for 2d6 hours if the secondary save is failed.\n\nShiver\n\nEnigmatic and eerily beautiful, dream spiders are now a hot commodity on the streets of Korvosa, where it&apos;s said their venom shows some the future.\n\nVenom milked directly from a dream spider is potent, but not particularly habit-forming. When the venom is boiled in a mixture of water, alcohol, and webbing gathered from dream spider nests, the result is an addictive drug called &#147;shiver.&#148; The process of creating the drug is complex, requiring a DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check to produce a single dose.\n\nShiver is taken by mouth, and its effects are swift. The drinker must make a DC 10 Fortitude save to resist taking 1 point of Wisdom damage. A minute later, he must save again or lapse into a comatose state for 1d4 hours, during which he experiences vivid, bizarre dreams. Each additional dose of shiver taken within 24 hours increases the DC to resist by +1 and the duration of the coma by 1d4 hours.\n\nShiver is extremely habit-forming. Each time a creature takes the drug, he can resist addiction with a DC 10 Fortitude check. An addicted character must make a DC 15 Fortitude save each week he doesn&apos;t use shiver to avoid taking 1d10 points of Wisdom damage. A character who makes two of these saving throws in a row recovers from his addiction." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rURedReave" name="Red Reaver" description="This hulking humanoid towers at a height of ten feet. Its body is thick and hairless, its gray hide flushing with crimson along the arms and legs. Strangely tiny bat-like jut from its shoulder blades while its gangly claws swing down to its ankles. Three separate pairs of crimson eyes hint at the creature&apos;s crude intellect, but its powerful jaws and razor-sharp talons dismiss any suggestion of docility.\n\nSlow-witted but possessed of a dangerous temper, massive red reavers are violent forces of nature. With weights of almost 4,500 pounds, they often leave sizeable depressions in the ground when they crash to earth upon their disproportionately small wings. While red reavers do not seek out creatures to battle and are rarely aggressive at first, these simple creatures&apos; territorial natures and tendency to misinterpret threats make approaching one an exceedingly dangerous proposition.\nEcology\n\nRed reavers are omnivorous. They spend days at a time hunting along rivers and secluded shorelines for fish and larger creatures that come to the water to drink. While red reavers often seek out caves in foul weather, most of the time these brutes merely collapse where they stand when overcome by slumber.\n\nSimple in both heart and mind, red reavers are often transfixed by the natural beauty of random curiosities. On occasion, red reavers have been spotted standing as still as statues watching multi-colored sunsets. Others might be beguiled for hours when they spy their own reflection in a clear pool of water. Tales are told of red reavers drawn to traveling bards, the reaver listening to the minstrel&apos;s music with fascination but then unintentionally tearing the hapless performer to shreds after the exhausted bard at last puts down his instrument.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nRed reavers prefer to live among mountain ranges, particularly those with an abundance of rivers and streams or near the sea. The massive brawlers are almost always solitary, save for a brief frenetic mating season every 6 years. Following its live birth, a reaver infant grows swiftly and leaves home within months, eager to claim its own territory.\n\nRed reavers do not get along with gray renders. A chance passing between the two invariably results in an immediate brawl. Each brute clamps its jaws on the other&apos;s neck and the pair rolls around on the ground as each tears away at its opponent&apos;s flesh, completely oblivious to its surrounding environment. Although these battles are often long and vicious, they are rarely fought to the death.\nBonded Site\n\nLike their gray render cousins, red reavers possesses the curious habit of bonding, although red reavers typically become the stalwart guardians of places or particular things. Red reavers imprint themselves with a unique natural structure, such as unusual outcroppings of rocks, pristine waterfalls, or even elaborately grown, solitary trees. In more unusual cases, though, the brutes might find a discarded piece of art, a statue in a ruined temple, or even an ornate monument or road post to fixate on.\n\nUpon finding a location or beautiful work, a reaver usually stays in close proximity to the site. A red reaver guards its bonded site from a distance, content to simply check in from time to time and stare in wonderment. When its favored site is approached by other creatures, though, a red reaver rushes in to guard its charge, roaring at the first whiff of danger.\n\nIf a red reaver&apos;s bonded site is ever moved or destroyed, the brawler flies into a vengeful rage, wrecking whatever it comes across and slaying everyone it believes responsible-typically the first living creatures it encounters after finding its charge damaged. After its spat of mournful revenge is complete, the reaver collapses and blubbers for days on end. It takes 1d4 days before a red reaver who has lost its bonded site spontaneously brightens and wanders off to find a new locale to adopt.\nSample Red Reavers\n\nAlthough red reavers in Golarion are rare overall, their savagery is usually sufficient to leave a lasting impression.\n\nAuger: The sleepy village of Caldamin, along Andoran&apos;s Verduan Forest, has long enjoyed the protection of an old gray render called Shepherd Graygulp, a name chosen for the beast&apos;s habit of adopting lambs within Caldamin&apos;s herds as its bonded companions. Within the same territory is a wild red reaver known to the Caldaminians as Auger, who occasionally comes to feed upon the sheep under Graygulp&apos;s protection. The titanic battles that ensue when these monstrous brutes encounter one another is the stuff of legend. As such, much to Caldamin&apos;s dismay,  the village has now begun to attract foreigners known as &#147;Auger Watchers,&#148; who make the trip to Caldamin in hopes of witnessing or-in a recent unfortunate case-eliciting the famous brawl.\n\nThe Ripper: On a journey 3 years ago, Free Captain Kelsin Southmoore, in command of the frigate Hurassa III,captured a slumbering red reaver from the West Bandu Hills of Sargava on the beach of Desperation Bay. After his men amputated the creature&apos;s wings, he entered it in the infamous Viper Cage, Ilizmagorti&apos;s bestial pitfighting competition. The enraged reaver, nicknamed &#147;The Ripper,&#148; was the first beast to ever survive and go on to win two consecutive tournaments and has been a local favorite ever since.\n\nThe Red Warden: The Lastwall village of Roslar&apos;s Coffer, just east of the Mindspin Mountains, was overrun by orc raiders several seasons ago, driving off the local residents. Although the rampaging orcs were eventually put to the sword, in the survivors&apos; absence a red reaver wandered into the area and become infatuated with the striking fa&#231;ade of the village&apos;s burnt shrine of Sarenrae. The villagers have tried to return to their homes, but every time anyone gets too close, the reaver chases them off." compset="Race">

Amid this eerie crowd of dancing specters looms a dark cloaked figure wielding a scythe, an ominous wraith with the dreaded countenance of Death itself.\n\nDanse macabres embody the inevitability of death. They represent the ultimate equalizer of station, revealing in their dance of death the futility of all life. In the end all mortal beings must face the fateful piper and dance to its tune.\n\nIncorporeal and ominous, danse macabres typically manifest as looming, black-cloaked skeletons, although they might appear in other sinister forms depending on personifications of death unique to the cultures near where they manifest, typically a fiery pillar, a pale child, or a man in a white mask. The crowd of dancing souls that surround these 10-foot-tall specters typically do little to dispel their ominous aura.\nEcology\n\nAs undead creatures, danse macabres require nothing from their environments and contribute nothing in return. Their very presence typically suggests the murder of large numbers of creatures and, upon their horrifying manifestations, the deaths of others that happen too near.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nA danse macabre is a solitary creature that seeks only to call others to join its eternal celebration of the inevitable. They only manifest in locations tainted by untimely deaths-the sites of countless violent executions, estates overrun by deadly plagues, or on battlefields where mass slaughters took place. The common thread is that at all of these locations hundreds, if not thousands, of victims met their fate, often in rapid succession. None claim to know what terrible death count or measurement of psychic trauma is required to spawn a danse macabre, and indeed, some of the most gore-soaked sites in Golarion have never led to one of these beings&apos; manifestations. An element of grim irony or communal revenge tends to inspire such hauntings, making it impossible to predict what catastrophe or massacre might cause one to appear.\n\nSome scholars of the undead suggest that danse macabre harbor no hate for the living, merely a natural drive to bring them to their final state on an accelerated schedule. Witnesses of danse macabres, however, tend to disagree, and the manifestation of a danse macabre can quickly depopulate a location through both its depredations and the flight of any survivors. Fortunately, though, these morbid shades rarely move far from the site of their initial manifestation, leading to numerous tales of haunted halls where the dead endlessly dance in their eternal revel." compset="Race">

  <thing id="raUSpiritA" name="Spirit Anchor" description="Through the use of its chain spirit ability (see below), a chained spirit can gain power by binding other powerful creatures to a specific area. There are several facets to this ability, both for the chained spirit and those bound by it.\n\nGaining A Spirit Anchor: Any time a chained spirit creates a spirit anchor using its chain spirit ability, it gains the following benefits: a +2 profane bonus to Armor Class, fast healing 5, an incorporeal chain attack, immunity to being turned, rebuked, or controlled, spectral sight, and spectral bindings (see below). \n     These benefits stack. Therefore, a chained spirit with 4 spirit anchors gains a +8 profane bonus to AC, fast healing 20, four chain attacks, and immunity to being turned, rebuked, or controlled. (The stats presented\nhere represent a chain spirit with 4 spirit anchors and include all the associated benefits.) In addition, for as long as at least one of its spirit anchors exists, a chained spirit cannot be destroyed. If reduced to 0 hit points, the chained spirit reappears with full hit points 1 minute later. A chained spirit can have up to 4 spirit anchors at any time.\n\nLosing a Spirit Anchor: If a spirit anchor is destroyed or released, a chained spirit&apos;s benefits are reduced: its AC is reduced by 2, its fast healing is reduced by 5, and it looses one of its chain attacks. If all of a chained spirit&apos;s\nspirit anchors are destroyed, it gains no profane bonus to AC, has no fast healing, has no chain attacks, and can be permanently destroyed, but is released from the the effects of its spectral bindings.\n     A chained spirit who is reduced from 4 spirit anchors to 3 cannot use its chain spirit ability for 24 hours. After that time, though, it can attempt to establish a new spirit anchor as normal. Losing more spirits does not affect this ability. \n\nSpirit Anchor Effects: A creature that becomes an anchor spirit is affected in two ways. First, it instantly regains any Charisma drained from it by the chain spirit ability of the chained spirit it becomes anchored to. Secondly, it is bound\nto the location it became an anchoring spirit-the exact spot where it was reduced to 0 Charisma by the chain spirit ability. Spirit anchors typically cannot move farther than 100 feet from this anchor spot. In the cases of creatures that require wider mobility to fulfill their physical needs, a chain spirit can relax its grip on creatures, allowing them to range farther afield.\nHowever, the chain spirit can employ a compulsion similar to geas/quest at will, forcing the spirit anchor to return to its anchor spot. A spirit anchor that ignores the compulsion take 1d6 points of Charisma damage per day until it returns. \n   The anchor spirit&apos;s own death, or the spells dispel evil, dispel law, freedom, miracle, or wish, can release a spirit anchor. Beyond this restraint, a chained spirit holds no special control over its spirit anchors." compset="RaceSpec">

Any creature targeted by this ability is immediately aware of some malevolence attempting to take control of it.\nThe effects of being drained to 0 Charisma by this ability-by one or multiple attacks-depends on the target creature&apos;s Hit Dice. If the creature has fewer than half the chained spirit&apos;s number of Hit Dice, being reduced to 0 Charisma kills the target.

If another creature occupies the space it has left, that creature is shunted to the closest available square. If a solid object occupies it starting square, its incorporeal nature allows it to return regardless. Even a force effect cannot thwart it as it simply reappears within\nthe square, though if it is surrounded by a force effect, the chained spirit is then effectively trapped." compset="RaceSpec">

  <thing id="rUCinderWo" name="Cinder Wolf" description="This wolf-like beast has a charred and blackened hide, its flesh split in places and seeping a fiery red ooze. The slaving creature stalks closer, snarling gutturally as cinders flicker from its maw.\n\nVicious predators and tireless trackers, cinder wolves are a relentless threat to the travelers and native tribes who make the Cinderlands their home. Ravenous creatures that endlessly hunt to fuel their fiery metabolisms, cinder wolves attack nearly any creature, from well-armored horned spirestalkers and ember scorpions to Shoanti barbarians and even stone giant warriors. Fleet footed and fearsome in appearance, these tenacious pack hunters thrive amid the flames of the Cinderlands, their fiery bites and relentless hunger embodying the deadliness of the burning plains. An adult cinder wolf stands just over 3 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds. What little fur they have is often singed and black, but can also be ash-gray. Their eyes are frequently bloodshot red with yellow irises.\nEcology\n\nSages widely hold that cinder wolves were originally the offspring of the Kodar crag wolf-now found almost exclusively along the western and northern faces of the mountain range-and hell hounds kept by ancient wizards and their minions. Although countless generations have bred the outsider nature out of modern cinder wolves, the fiery connection to their distant relatives remains readily apparent in their dark fur and flaming breath.\n\nCinder wolves are unfortunate creatures, as even after centuries of survival, the blood of natural creatures and their hellish ancestors does not mix well. Although the species breeds true and is more than capable of survival, the life of a cinder wolf pup is often short and painful. Unborn cinder wolves do not gain their resistance to flame until late in their mothers&apos; pregnancies, developing it as a reaction to the intense heat of their mothers&apos; metabolism and countless burns while still being carried. Thus, of the dozen or so pups a mother typically births, more than half are stillborn, and even those that do survive bear lifelong scars.\n\nWhile the infernal fires of a hell hound are a product of its connection to the Lower Planes, in a cinder wolf they rely upon an unnatural quick metabolism for fuel. As such, cinder wolves are constantly hungry, needing to eat several times their weight each week-a particular difficulty in a region as harsh as the Cinderlands-lest the flames within them run low. When these fires gutter out completely, the cinder wolf dies as well. Cinder wolves are somewhat short-lived, as they are only resistant to the Cinderlands&apos; annual firestorms and not immune. While their resilience and instincts allow most to weather or avoid the worst emberstorms or volcanic events, a sizable portion of the cinder wolf population is culled every year when particularly deadly storms blow through.\n\nA cinderwolf &apos;s vision is remarkable in its ability to view heat to a limited extent. By following the lingering heat left by a creature&apos;s passage, cinderwolves are adept at tracking live prey. This heat sight proves limited beyond its usefulness in tracking, though, and too weak for the hunters to glimpse prey through solid barriers.\nCinder Wolf Pelts\n\nThe hides of cinder wolves prove exceptionally useful in the creation of heat resilient armors. By making a DC 16 Survival check, one can successfully skin a cinder wolf, leaving its coarse pelt in quality good enough to work into armor or other goods. Should this pelt be used later in the creation of a suit of hide armor (in addition to all the normal materials, DC 13 Craft [armorsmithing]), that armor can be enhanced with the fire resistance, improved fire resistance, or greater fire resistance special abilities at 75% of the normal price. A cinder wolf pelt is an uncommon commodity and can rarely be found for sale, the bristly fur being uncomfortable and hard to work with and the demand-despite their usefulness in magic-is limited. Even when found in Varisian markets, the cost is typically upwards of 600 gp. Thus, most who desire a cinder wolf pelt are forced to either find and skin a cinder wolf himself, or trade with Shoanti native to the Cinderlands.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nA typical cinder wolf den might have as many as a dozen adults, with as many as double that number adolescents and cubs. When threatened, all but the cubs fight, the older wolves doing all they can to bring down or lead off danger.\n\nCinder wolves build their lairs in hot places: near gas fields, on the edges of cinder cones, and within rocky outcroppings exposed to the midday heat and frequent emberstorms. The predators favor such lairs as they suffer near constant pain from their skin splitting and rupturing in cool air. Aside from finding smoldering dens, their only relief from this pain comes from licking themselves-thus exposing their skin to their fiery breath-but it is a very small comfort at best.\n\nThe Shoanti of the Cinderlands hunt cinder wolves when their numbers become too great for the local wildlife to support-usually just prior to significant annual firestorms-and the predators begin turning their attention to the humanoid tribes. Many barbarian tribes hold annual hunts specifically to thin the numbers of the cinder wolves and reduce the predators&apos; depredations on their tribes. Experienced hunters who have slain more than one cinder wolf usually sew the pelts together to make hide armor and blankets.\nTraining Cinder Wolves\n\nThe constant hunger and pain cinder wolves endure make them hard to manage and even more difficult to tame. Taming a cinder wolf requires 6 weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. This DC decreases to 20 if the beast is trained in an area that is constantly 100 degrees or hotter. Even after this initial training, though, the DCs of all attempts to further train a cinder wolf are 5 higher, unless they&apos;re again made in areas of extreme heat. Although difficult to teach and quick to disobey, cinder wolves make excellent trackers and are widely coveted by hunters on the Storval Plateau and beyond." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUAkaruzu" name="Akaruzug" description="A grim statue quietly hovers here, its slow, seemingly weightless bobbing belying its obvious bulk. Sculpted in the shape of a grim, horned angel, gigantic wings and terrible, long clawed arms jut from a legless body that tapers into a blunt, blade-like trunk. Upon the ominous form&apos;s breast hang the fresh remains of a crucified corpse.\n\nAkaruzugs serve as temptations of the Lower Planes, powerful, blasphemous constructs rarely used by fiends, but whose designs are coveted by diabolical mortal magic users. Crafted in the appearance of grim, towering angels and creatures of warped beauty, these creations stand in mockery of light, life, and all that is good. By their very existence-powered by souls trapped in torment-they spread death and despair, their every atrocity heaping guilt upon the dark souls of their creators.\n\nMost akaruzugs are 15 feet tall or larger, and weigh upward of 3 tons, depending on the materials used in their creation. They commonly attack using claws, wings, and the lashing of a broad sword-like tail, though some akaruzugs have been created with multiple arms and great impaling horns.\nEcology\n\nIn an akaruzug&apos;s creation process, a powerful warrior is entombed alive within a massive sculpture of lead, granite, or iron. As the statue&apos;s shape is refined and empowered-a process involving the efforts of a skilled artisan and a magic-user adept at channeling diabolical powers-the warrior inside slowly expires, her weakening screams and futile struggles likely sounding through the sculpture as it develops. As part of the rite to animate the akaruzug, the body is washed over in hellfire, a process that reduces the body inside into a substance similar to packed ash.\n\nThese remains and the magic woven over the construct prevent the escape of the lingering warrior soul within. At this point, the akaruzug&apos;s &#147;soul engine&#148; is complete, but the construct still requires spirit energy to animate. Constructed with shackles upon its breast, the construct requires a second creature to be sacrificed to activate it, the unfortunate soul being drawn into the ash and smoldering hellish cinders within the foul construct. This second infusion of stolen life force activates the akaruzug, causing it to rise into the air and spread its profane aura. From then on, it is a grim slave to its creator&apos;s perverse will.\n\nAlthough mindless, akaruzugs have an innate hatred for the living. Terrible icons of evil, they typically remain still, hovering ominously above the ground, bearing their crucified burden and shedding their blasphemous aura. Unless specifically forbidden by its master, an akaruzug attacks any mortal creature that it detects, attempting to consume ever more life force.\n\nWith their ominous shapes, unsettling abilities, and the corpse displayed upon their breasts, akaruzugs are often used as terrifying messengers, blasphemous retaliations against those who would stand against the constructs&apos; creator. When the Taldan knight Arstlan besieged the tower of Vodcross, the home of the cruel wizard Cheseive, Poison Lady of Ganholm, he was not heard from for weeks. When he reemerged, it was in rent armor, crucified upon the breast of a serpent-winged akaruzug bearing his face. The thing laid waste to Ganholm, and hovered soundlessly above the ruins for thirteen years before finally being felled by the adventurers known as the Order of Vermilion.\nHabitat and Society\n\nAs unthinking constructs, akaruzugs have no ways or culture of their own. Rather, they are used by infernal tempters to spread the dark works of devils and further diabolical agendas. Due to the murder and dark spells required to create an akaruzug, becoming the master of one of these hellish creations is in itself a damning act. As the plans for creating these creatures are well documented in the libraries of the Nine Hells, watchful and conniving devils often assure that these formulas fall into the hands of cruel, ambitious, and desperate spellcasters in answer to their Hell-bound wishes.\nConstruction\nCL 15th; Price:  175,000 gp\n\nAn akaruzug is created from a 15-foot-tall hollow statue of a fallen angel. More than 6,000 pounds of dark stone, iron, or lead are utilized in the construct&apos;s creation, along with a variety of rare infernal admixtures and empowering agents costing at least 15,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 24 Craft (sculpting) or Craft (armorsmithing) check. In addition, a martially skilled humanoid of at least 5th level must be trapped inside the sculpture. Craft Construct, enervation, magic jar, unhallow, caster must be at least 15th level; Cost 95,000 gp." compset="Race">

A creature who makes a grapple attempt against an akaruzug can target the body hung on the construct. The akaruzug gains a +10 bonus on the opposed grapple check to keep its victim in place. If the akaruzug fails this check, its victim is freed. Casting a spell like teleport object on an akaruzug&apos;s victim can remove it from its bindings. If a saving throw is allowed to resist the spell, the akaruzug makes it for its victim. As an akaruzug&apos;s victim is dead, it no longer counts as a creature for the purposes of spells that target individuals.

Bearing a gigantic hammer almost too large for it to hold, the sculpture depicts thick, rigid armor, but no details beneath, hiding the identity of the wearer. Upon its breast gleams a golden relief of runes, a key, and a shining city.\n\nAbadar&apos;s herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a 25-foot-tall giant in elaborate golden armor and bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still, the Lawgiver appears as a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of law. When active, its steps shake the earth and the blow of its legendary hammer-the godforged Gavel of Abadar- can shatter castle walls. Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First Vault, the Lawgiver is like an intelligent golden volcano: mountainous and indomitable, yet capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder progress&apos;s inexorable march.\n\nTerse in nature, the herald of Abadar restricts communication to an unusual limit. Although the giant can speak several languages, it has only ever been heard speaking in numbers and measurements or-more frequently-in direct quotes from Abadar&apos;s holy writings, the Order of Numbers or the Manual of City Building. Encyclopedic in its knowledge of the god of cities&apos;s holy texts, this restriction rarely prevents the Lawgiver from making its intentions known.\nEcology\n\nA unique titan of living metal, the Lawgiver has no apparent need for food, drink, rest, or other mortal comforts. On most of its rare appearances, the creature&apos;s stoicism and stillness lead even devout worshipers of the Judge of the Gods to mistake the giant for a reward from their god or simply one temple&apos;s ostentatious display of piety. More than once, needy clerics or thieving heretics have attempted to chip away parts of the golden herald or melt it down entirely, with the Lawgiver&apos;s reaction varying depending on the individual assaulting. While thieves are typically crushed beneath the giant&apos;s heel, in some cases the Lawgiver seems to have no purpose other than to allow a struggling or robbed temple to sheer off a few hundred coins&apos; worth of gold so it might continue its work. The titan always seems to heal lost pieces when seen next, but it never grants those who summon it permission to take gold from its body.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nThe Lawgiver goes where powerful worshipers of Abadar call him and where the god of cities and law orders. While a literal giant on the battlefield, often the mere suggestion of the Lawgiver&apos;s prowess or the Master of the First Vault&apos;s displeasure is enough to avert a disruptive conflict completely. Amid the harrowing accounts of Gojan the Sharp&apos;s trials in Numeria, volume 3 of the Pathfinder Chronicles relates a widely debated episode involving a mysterious golden statue that numerous modern theologians identify as the herald of Abadar.\n\nAccording to Gojan, in the fearful night prior to what seemed to be an inevitable slave revolt, a massive and magnificent statue appeared upon the Sable Barrow, one of the hills overlooking the city of Chesed. Holding a gigantic hammer and posed as if ready to smite the city, the mysterious statue bore the symbol of the Judge of the Gods upon its breast, looming like some divine threat. The figure baffled slave and master alike, ultimately leading many of the superstitious rebels to reconsider their murderous uprising. The mysterious statue disappeared four nights later, but within a week&apos;s time Gojan bore witness to the fifth Barrow Siege, wherein savage hordes from the west sought to raze Chesed. The city barely resisted, winning a costly victory that would have been unimaginable in the wake of a crippling internal revolt.\n\nOn several occasions in the past century, followers of the god of law have reported seeing the Lawgiver wandering remote places, from ancient caves to deep underwater trenches, seemingly searching for something. Neither Abadar nor the golden titan ever speak of these travels, leading to widespread conjecture and debate among the faith of the Gold-Fisted." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rURajputAm" name="Rajput Ambari" description="Standing motionless, this creature could easily be mistaken for a huge skeletal display of a long-dead war elephant. At further glance, its eyes burn a smoky black and pieces of stench-ridden flesh hang from crusty bones. Rusty barding drapes loosely over its skeletal spine, and ancient, rotten finery hangs over its skull and drapes flaccidly toward the ground.\n\nHorrors born from the depths of Vudra&apos;s endless jungles, rajput ambari are undead elephants granted terrible powers through necromantic rites. Massive and terrifying, many of these earth-shaking undead behemoths retain the exotic trappings and elegant finery of the Vudrani princes who once doted upon them. The glory of such beasts is long forgotten, though, as most serve as unholy slaves and fearless beasts of war for uncaring necromancers and deathless masters.\nEcology\n\nThe size of a rajput ambari varies widely depending on which part of the world the original elephant skeleton came from-Vudrani elephants typically near 16 feet in height, while Mwangi elephants grow up to 18 feet tall. Juvenile elephant skeletons are almost never used to create a rajput ambari. In Vudra, undead elephants are feared abominations, but terrifying rumors tell of lumbering mastadons from the distant north being animated in rituals akin to those that create rajput ambaris.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nRajput ambaris have no societal structure, functioning only as their creators command. Vudrani necromancers typically use rajput ambaris much like living elephants, though without the need for handlers. Thus, when encountered, most are found performing menial tasks, serving as guards, or transporting undead warriors. Although rajput ambaris are unintelligent undead, necromantic scholars postulate that some facet of the rites used to create the undead beasts causes them to retain some vestige of instinct. The evidence of this theory rises in the rare cases in which a rajput ambari is left without a master. When no longer able to perform past orders or left without commands for weeks, a rajput ambari sometimes begins walking of its own accord. In these rare and seemingly impossible situations, the undead elephant tends to wander back to the lands where it was captured and might even re-adopt some of the motions and tendencies of life-much to the horror of local hunters and living elephants alike.\nCreating a Rajput Ambari\n\nA spellcaster of 18th level or higher can create a rajput ambari utilizing the create undead spell. In addition to the usual components required by the spell, though, the rite to animate a rajput ambari requires the full skeleton of an adult elephant and adornment of a regal bearing. At the very least, these additions add 400 gp to the spell&apos;s total cost.\nOrigins of the Rajput Ambari\n\nAlthough none can say who created the first skeleton or raised the first zombie, the rajput ambari is an unusual undead in that its creation is well documented in Vudrani lore. In 4465 ar, the necromancer-priest Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan, known as the Vile Prince, gathered together his cult of followers in the mountains and jungles of northern Vudra and set about building a dark citadel, a temple to all the foul powers of Vudrani lore and a personal palace where his experiments would go largely unnoticed. Shivji&apos;s first need was labor-labor that didn&apos;t need rest or sleep to realize his grand designs. Thus, his morbid imagination fell upon the great elephant graveyards of the Ajitesh Valley. In short order, he raised an army of undead elephants, which his followers took to calling rajput ambaris-a combination of their necromantic lord&apos;s title and the Vudrani word for the carriage house that living elephants sometimes carry upon their backs. With insight to see past his megalomania, Shivji left his minions susceptible to the commands of other worshipers of dark deities, bestowing his most trusted lieutenants with the knowledge to command them in his absence. With the aid of his titanic undead, Shivji&apos;s fortress rose with frightening speed-a citadel of a thousand thousand skulls he called the Palace of Ivory and Bone. Once the fortress was completed, dozens of rajput ambaris were put to work pulling the massive winches required to open the heavy, elephant-tusk gates of the citadel. Shivji Shashibhushan&apos;s war against the Vudrani mahajanapadas ended 40 years after the completion of the Palace of Ivory and Bone, with the necromancer slain at the head of his largest rajput ambari host. Even as his horrorfilled castle eventually sank into obscurity and lore, Shivji&apos;s rajput ambaris-his greatest feat as a necromancer-linger on even as his name is slowly forgotten." compset="Race">

The face staring contemplatively ahead bears beautiful human features, but from the creature&apos;s neck emerge several fearsome animal heads, each considering a different direction.\n\nAll rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession, it&apos;s a birthright. Legends among rakshasa-kind tell of the maharajahs-those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind remaking them as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajahs inspire one emotion that few can in the race: fear.\nEcology\n\nA rakshasa maharajah emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and influence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa&apos;s social-spiritual caste system. In a method not altogether understood even by the fiends, when rakshasas of legendary cruelty reincarnate, sometimes their new forms exhibit the increased powers and multiple heads of a maharajah. When a rakshasa ascends to maharajah status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharajah-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The appearance of a maharajah denotes that great change is imminent: the maharajah will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasa, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or face some greater foe who breaks its domain into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of rakshasa maharajahs to emerge in the same century.\n\nThere are tales of even greater rakshasa forms than the maharajah, great beings with more heads than can be counted and more power that can be imagined. Such a state might be a further evolution from maharajah, or it might be a unique form created by the creature&apos;s destiny and ambition.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nSo great is a rakshasa maharajah&apos;s power and influence that it can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharajah is powerful enough, goodaligned outsiders-lounging in opulence.\n\nThe lair of a rakshasa maharajah is typically a glorious, decadent thing. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes of rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, great pillows stuffed with exotic feathers-and crafted from the hides of even more exotic creatures-serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants.\n\nA rakshasa maharajah&apos;s great experience and power, however, does not make it immune or ignorant to threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a rakshasa maharajah&apos;s rule. To that end, a maharajah employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajahs have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUSikariMa" name="Sikari Macaque Swarm" description="Hundreds of tiny, hairless, reddish-hued monkeys burst from the thick jungle canopy. All at once, they&apos;re climbing every tree, swinging from every branch, covering every inch of the ground. Their mouths seem permanently open in a yowling shriek, a cacophony of rage only half as fearsome as their tiny, bulbous black eyes.\n\nOften called the Red Wind, a churning mass of Sikari macaques feels no fear, barely acknowledges pain, and destroys everything in its path. A species of monkeys native to the Sikari region of Vudra, Sikari macaques are small, hairless, and mean. Their appearance and temperament are not native traits, however, as within recorded Vudran history nearly every member of the species has fallen victim to a mysterious affliction known as Sikari rage. Thus, what was once a highly social and endearingly curious breed of tawny-furred monkeys has been reduced to gangs of flesh-hungry brutes shrieking through jungle boughs, consuming and demolishing anything in their path. A typical Sikari macaque stands just over 1 foot tall and weighs less than 5 pounds. Swarms of these deadly primates usually number from 30 to nearly a hundred.\n\nEcology\n\nFor the overwhelming population of Sikari macaques infected with Sikari rage, life begins exactly as they live it: enraged. After a relatively short gestation period of 4 months, a Sikari macaque is born into a tumultuous world of spinning fur and gnashing teeth. Snatched up by its mother or another female and carried along with the swarming host, a newborn Sikari macaque is a naked, squealing thing, all thrashing limbs and snapping teeth. In only a few days&apos; time, though, these infantile tantrums become the wild rages of a swiftly moving, sharp-clawed, and dangerously crazed member of the primate swarm.\n\nSikari macaques in captivity have lived nearly 20 years, but in the wild their lives are much shorter, usually no more than 5. The Red Wind doesn&apos;t just leave a sea of destruction and shattered plant life in its wake, it also leaves a path of twisted primate corpses. The monkeys might not feel pain when deep in the thrall of their rage, but the vicious, clawing mass of fellow macaques inevitably overwhelms sickly children and crippled or infirm adults. Those unable to keep up and fend for themselves-against both prey and the beatings of their fellows-are either consumed or tossed aside to bleed their last into the soft jungle soil. The macaques subsist on meat from any creature they can pick off alone or overwhelm as a swarm. They&apos;re generally nocturnal, preferring to find perches high in the jungle canopy in which to rest while the sun slips across the sky. During mating season, however, Sikari macaques can be found awake and restless for weeks on end. Mating season seems totally random and many scholars believe that a family unit instinctually knows when it has room to grow and does so.\n\nAn individual Sikari macaque is gaunt, thin, and completely lacking hair. Their pale skin is splotchy and covered in patches of angry red welts-a symptom of the disease that infects their species. Bulbous onyx eyes stare blankly out of high eye sockets and their mouths seem to perpetually hang open, revealing thin rows of knife-edge teeth. Their hands and feet end in needle-like claws, and their grip is far stronger than one would expect from an animal of such small stature.\n\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nEven in their diseased rage, Sikari macaques form tight family units of up to a hundred genetically linked monkeys. These families are constantly on the move, their incensed natures driving them rabidly onward. Swarms of the ravenous primates slow and finally rest only during the hottest hours of the day, and even then usually only for a period of 4 to 6 hours. Although rarely spied by outside observers, during these exhausted hours the primates nurture their offspring, although this extends to little more than mercilessly teaching their young how to hunt and fight, and where to best attack larger beasts.\n\nAlthough interactions between Sikari macaques are typically violent, their disease-addled deadliness increases tenfold when directed toward prey or actual threats. Without warning, dozens of individual macaques merge into a single roiling mass of red-hued flesh, capable of shredding even a tiger as they tear their way through the jungle. Having no real attachment to any one specific location, Sikari macaques travel aimlessly and often far from their native breeding grounds, swarming over anything slow or stupid enough to cross their path. Sometimes, swarms of Sikari macaques cross paths.\n\nThose members not killed outright in the resulting violence come together to form a larger swarm. In extreme cases, multiple swarms might collect and travel together, forming large, dangerous groups called furies or frenzies. Vudrani hunters have a special and rightful fear of Sikari macaque frenzies, with many paying monthly penance to Lahkgya of the Red Face, Patron of Monkeys, in hopes that he won&apos;t unleash his deadly children upon their hunting grounds or villages.\n\nSikari macaques can most commonly be found in the thick, vine-choked Sikari region of northern Vudra. Although they fear nothing, their swarms tend to stay far away from civilization, preferring vegetation-choked mountain slopes or deep river valleys.\n\nSikari Rage\n\nSikari macaques suffer from a deadly, highly virulent disease known in Vudra as Sikari rage. Symptomatically akin to stages of rabies, the disease is spread by scratches and bites dealt by infected monkeys. Although most animals are immune to Sikari rage, humanoids and other types of macaques have dramatic reactions to the disease, almost immediately falling into a furious stupor as the affliction attempts to gain purchase. This rage passes in mere moments, however, as the highly selective malady swiftly dies outside of its chosen host species.\n\nThe first case of Sikari rage appeared near the village of Bannaquet in 4679 ar, not far from the ruins of Reverchaldam, former home of the ousted society of insidious alchemists known as the Breathers of Ash. What began as isolated attacks by crazed monkeys turned into a siege that the village barely withstood. Even today, most of the citizens of Bannaquet live upon the bare slopes of Sadar Vosdeol, forsaking outcasts and the poor to the lower neighborhoods of Old Monkey Town." compset="Race">

From it, the air splits with the deafening grind of bone-on-bone.\n\nBonestorms are the charnel offspring of vast battlefields, the wrathful resurrections of legions of the fallen unwilling to let go of their wrath and unable to accept defeat. Amid violent currents of tormented souls, the rent corpses of the fallen rise again, formless masses of marrow and splintered bone that know only revenge.\n\nWhile bonestorms can spontaneously form-typically days or weeks after a particularly violent or meaningful battle-they have also been known to be created by malicious necromancers and arcane warlords. Brought into being to serve as lifeless engines of war or to wreak havoc upon their creators&apos; enemies, bonestorms purposefully brought into existence have slightly more direction than their spontaneously forming counterparts. Upon completing a task, however, its not uncommon for one of these cyclones of bones to indulge its motivating rage, attacking and destroying living things far in excess of its creator&apos;s wishes.\n\nA bonestorm typically rises to about 10 feet tall, though it has no weight besides the hundreds of pounds of bones caught up in its macabre vortex.\nEcology\n\nBonestorms are wholly unnatural creations, formed of tortured souls and rage. As mindless undead, they exist only to serve their creators or, in the cases where these horrors come into being of their own accord or escape a master&apos;s control, blindly wreak their formless rage upon the living.\n\nBonestorms cannot be conversed with: they have no intellect of their own. If successfully rebuked, one of these undead swarms can be directed to follow simple commands, though once its instructions are exhausted, it goes back about its assault on the living.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nBonestorms are most commonly found wherever residual ill will and a sufficient supply of raw bone material permits them to subsist: graveyards, battlefields, and catacombs being most common. While bonestorms often rise from the corpses of defeated armies-especially those defeated while defending their countries, on religious crusades, or fighting for other strongly held beliefs-such grim sites are by no means the only places these horrors form. In some cases, bonestorms have been known to rise from trash mounds piled high with the discarded bones of wasted or maltreated animals, from the catacombs of the dishonored dead, from shipwreck sites on lonely desolate coastlines, and even from the ashes of unjustly burned outcasts. Wherever the lingering wrath of numerous souls and a large number of bones come together in one place, there might a bonestorm form.\n\nAlthough mindless, bonestorms do seem to be drawn to burial grounds, ossuaries, and similar areas of death. With their ability to gather up the remains of the dead to fuel their revenge, this draw seems to be less a matter of morbid affinity and more an instinct to sustain their existence and continue on their vengeful rampages.\nCreating a Bonestorm\n\nA cleric, wizard, or sorcerer may create a bonestorm by casting create greater undead, if the caster possesses the required caster level of 19th or higher. In addition to the material components required by the spell, the caster also requires 16 Hit Dice worth of unanimated corpses within 100 feet to use as raw material. These corpses may be separated from the caster by earth or walls, allowing the creator to animate the buried or entombed.\n\nAlthough mindless, and even when animated by magic, bonestorms are creatures of rage. This makes them relatively difficult to control. Whenever a bonestorm completes a task given it by its creator or other caster who has gain control of it, there is a 10% chance that the undead swarm breaks away from its controller and goes berserk, rampaging of its own accord. While a caster can regain control of a berserk bonestorm, it requires an additional control undead check.\nThe Bones of Bloodsworn\n\nIn 4396 ar, Chelish victory at the Battle of Bloodsworn Vale paved the way for southern colonization of the Varisian wilderness. This path, however, was opened with the bones of thousands of Shoanti warriors who, for all their ferocity and bravery, could not stop the march of Chelish imperialism. From the battlefields of Bloodsworn Vale rose one of the largest and most famous bonestorms in existence, simply called the Bones of Bloodsworn by those forced or frightened to travel the valley. Spontaneously formed from the corpses of thousands of Shoanti warriors determined to defend their lands even after their ignominious deaths,the incredible bonestorm was destroyed by a band of heroic early Korvosans known as the Watchers of the Way in 4411 ar. More than a dozen times in the past few centuries, however, bonestorms of terrible size and destructive power have spawned from Bloodsworn Vale&apos;s thorn-tangled earth, wreaking havoc and brutal revenge upon Varisia&apos;s invaders anew." compset="Race">

Every so often, the tip of one of the glistening filaments twitches to life, spontaneously growing a razor-like feeler, horrible eye, or other alien appendage. The creature&apos;s body is a looming clot of these appendages, a twitching knot of wriggling matter.\n\nThe word &#147;havero&#148; has its roots in ancient Thassilonian, roughly translating into &#147;smothering arms.&#148; The creature itself was first described in notes and theories postulated by ancient students of the stars and delvers into dark lore. Horrifically, haveros are not the mere imaginings of those sages who chronicle the heavens. They are entities of deepest lackness, and on terrible occasions a lone havero has been drawn to Golarion, putting all the races of the world into reach of its endless, ruinous arms.\nHistory\n\nThe existence of haveros was first discovered accidentally through the course of divination magics in the ancient empire of Thassilon. Ever seeking larger, more potent beasts to conjure and command, Thassilonian sages gradually uncovered the existence of a massive creature capable of spawning unlimited clawed horrors that dwelt far beyond the range of most remote viewing devices. Intrigued by a new potential source of military power buried somewhere in the night sky, the Thrallkeepers of Thassilon engaged in a race to be the first to secure a havero. When their wizards&apos; long-range spells of communication at last tapped the creatures&apos; minds and confirmed the existence of dark, maddening intelligences, the wizards&apos; desire to possess one only intensified. Methods of conjuring or otherwise leading the creatures to Golarion through the span of space were devised in haste. Eventually, coaxed by fathomless desires, a number of haveros ultimately permitted themselves to be drawn to Thassilon, but not to become pawns: the haveros came to kill.\nEcology\n\nAlthough their thought processes are too alien to permit interpretation, haveros are decidedly malevolent. They have no need for sustenance of any kind, yet they consume living creatures with mouths buried beneath their mounds of tentacles. Haveros do not age, nor do they die of any known natural cause. Beyond these apparent facts, though, exceedingly little rational knowledge has been gleaned about these unearthly horrors.\n\nA havero&apos;s tel pathy is theoretically limitless in range, although when sending its mind across galaxies, even its thoughts require considerable time to travel. The Thrallkeepers theorized that the accidental interception of a havero&apos;s stray thought might be a cause for some forms of madness and inexplicable genius. One sage even hypothesized that the ancient Thrallkeepers were able to transport haveros to Golarion not because of their own discoveries, but because the haveros quietly sent them the necessary ideas as to how they might accomplish the feat.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nThe ancient tome of starry observations and occult lore, On Verified Madness, refers to the havero&apos;s home as the farthest corner of &#147;The Dark Tapestry,&#148; a place that includes the blackness blotting the space between the stars. Haveros have no natural niche in Golarion and they exist only by the machinations of those who once possessed both the power and recklessness to transport them to this world. No one knows how many of these horrors lurk in the silent, lightless depths of the universe." compset="Race">

A havero has 20 appendage points, which it can spend as a full-round action to create a number of specialized appendages not exceeding this point total. As another full-round action, it can withdraw its tentacles back into itself, dissolving them and regaining the points spent to create them. If one of a havero&apos;s tentacles is destroyed in combat, it immediately regains the points used to create it. For example, a havero could use its 20 points to create 6 slashing tentacles, a grasping tentacle, and an incorporeal tentacle; 4 brilliant energy tentacles; 20 reaching tentacles; or any other number of tentacles whose sum total is 20 points. Haveros typically manifest the following tentacles, although some might have the ability to create more more. The point cost of each tentacle is listed after each name." compset="RaceSpec">

  <thing id="rUPrncChns" name="The Prince in Chains" description="This horrid thing looks like a skinless wolf and stands taller than a house. Its oozing muscle and tissues twitch and quiver as terrible lupine maws form and melt away into its fleshless body. These fanged gashes struggle forth from the beast&apos;s gigantic mass, but are restrained by layers of heavy, rusted chains that dangle and lash, constrict and loosen seemingly of their own insidious accord. Around the hellish wolf, the world is flogged by chains and barbed tendrils, flensing all things that come near.\n\nThe Prince in Chains is the herald of Zon-Kuthon, a living embodiment of the suffering and loss the Midnight Lord seeks to sow across the world. If the Dark Prince is an artist on the canvas of flesh and the fine gradations of pain are his pigments, the Prince in Chains is his dark masterpiece. The favor of the Midnight Lord has stripped the flesh from the spiritwolf &apos;s body and replaced it with haphazard layers of metal, leather, and the necrotic flesh of other beings.\n\nIts tongue has been embedded with dozens of barbed hooks and razors to make its bite far more terrible and damaging. Zon-Kuthon himself gouged out the Prince in Chains&apos;s eyes to make them receptacles of his own dark will, in which it&apos;s said mortals can see the fathomless dark dreams of the god of pain himself.\n\nThe Prince in Chains stands 18 feet tall and-bound in irons forged in the depths of Xovaikain-weighs nearly 3 tons. None have ever seen the beast without his shroud of chains, the torturous bonds having become impossibly knotted with his grotesque tendrils and a fundamental part of his body.\nEcology\n\nOriginally a noble spirit-wolf who, according to legend, sired dark Zon-Kuthon, the Prince in Chains has since been reduced to a travesty of its former self by the attentions of the Midnight Lord. Once noble, the Prince in Chains seems to revel only in pain-its infliction and its receipt-and sees in it a fundamental truth of life&apos;s very existence. Although it has no physical needs, it lashes out at any living creatures it encounters and loves to eviscerate helpless foes with its endlessly flailing chains and feast upon the remains with the countless mouths that perpetually form and melt back into its pulped body. It seeks to share its torment with all that it encounters, though it is well aware that most beings lack the stamina to truly appreciate the finer nuances of immortal suffering or survive long enough to experience the enlightenment found at its peak. It delights in the pain experienced by sentient beings more so than the sufferings of dumb animals, but is not above torturing and slaying a beloved pet or animal companion for the nourishing reward of anguish caused to its owner.\nThe Wolf That Was\n\nIn primordial times, a great spirit-wolf called Thron, the Prince That Howls, roamed the mountains, forests, and skies, singing his feral song to the earth, stars, and moon, proclaiming his love of life and song and love itself. He had many mates, and from his fertile loins sprang many more spirit-creatures. His two greatest offspring were Dou-Bral and Shelyn, children much greater than even their divine father, having a godly spark that elevated them above the great spirits. When his son left Golarion and returned as Zon-Kuthon, the Prince That Howls greeted him with a joyous noise born of ages past, a noise that choked in his throat when the corrupted god bound him in razor-sharp chains and dragged him off as a plaything. For years, Zon-Kuthon tortured his own father, peeling away strips of his immortal flesh and fashioning it into minions after his own mind. Long ago the beautiful voice was silenced, now only able to gurgle, screech, and gnash his teeth. This thing now serves the Midnight Lord as a pet called the Prince in Chains, further evidence of Zon-Kuthon&apos;s blasphemous nature.\n\nThough not intended as a homily, priests of Zon-Kuthon tell this tale to convince others that no friendship or family tie should preclude the god&apos;s servants from wreaking their god&apos;s terrible will.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nThe Prince in Chains wanders the depths of the Plane of Shadow and patrols the lightless steel labyrinths of Xoviakain, seeking others with whom to share its epiphanies of pain. Around its son-turned-master, however, the Prince in Chains is a simpering pup, unwilling to look the god of loss in the eye, whining equally for the attention of a careless caress or a boneshattering kick. If summoned to the Material Plane by a servant of Zon-Kuthon, the Prince in Chains responds particularly well if given human flesh to consume after a bit of playful torture. Kuthite clerics view a wound bestowed by the Prince of Chains as a near unparalleled blessing, though few can hope to survive such an honor." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="raUPhisCo" name="Infernal Contract" description="As a full-round action, a contract devil can produce an infernal contract for a single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects. To receive these benefits, however, the mortal must sign his true name to the document of his own free will. Upon doing so the mortal&apos;s soul is foresworn to the contract devil, condemning him to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall him after death. Thus, should the mortal die, no spell or ability short of divine intervention can resurrect him. In return for a mortal soul, contract devils commonly draft one of the following three contracts.\n\n    Evil Wishes: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted 3 wishes, as per the spell wish. He can use these wishes immediately or at a point in the future by calling upon the contract devil (see the devil&apos;s infernal investment) ability. While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase his wish.\n\n    Hellbound Heart: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is bound to a specific willing devil, gaining the devil-bound template (see the Advanced Bestiary). If the mortal does not name a particular fiend or type of devil the contract devil chooses one for him.\n\n    Infernal Slave: A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. The mortal chooses any type of devil with Hit Dice equal to or less than his own at the time of the bargain (except for a contract devil). Upon signing the contract, the mortal&apos;s infernal slave appears and is bound to do him no harm and follow his orders for as long as he lives. Although the devil must obey its master&apos;s commands, many devils delight in corrupting their orders&apos; intentions in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways.\n\nBreaking a Contract: An agreement with a contract devil can only be broken in two ways. Upon a contract being signed, two copies of the contract are made, one held by the devil and one given to the mortal. Mortals are free to do whatever they please with the lengthy, obviously evil documents, and contract devils typically keep all of their active contracts with them at all times. Should both a mortal and a contract devil&apos;s copies of a contract be destroyed, any effects caused by the contract (spell effects, granted templates, etc.) are canceled or reversed and the mortal&apos;s soul goes to its normal place of rest after death and can be resurrected as normal.\n\nAlternatively, a second mortal might be allowed to adopt the terms of a contract-his soul replacing that of the original contract signer after death. The mortal who seeks to pay the debt of another must contact the contract devil who holds the relevant contract. The contract devil has a choice in whether or not to allow one mortal to pay another&apos;s debt, but value religious and good-aligned souls over others. Shrewd manipulators, contract devils often only agree to allow one mortal to pay another&apos;s debt in return for some service or proof of worth. If a contract devil agrees to accept another soul in payment, the original contract signer retains all of the benefits of his contract, but is released from damnation and may be resurrected as normal. The new signer, however, receives no benefits, cannot be returned to life upon dying, and spends an eternity in Hell after death." compset="RaceSpec">

Reptilian wings unfurl from its leaking corpulence, its frame heaped with rolls of corded muscle and moist frog fat. Three buckler-sized yellow eyes protrude above a wide, drooling maw lined with teeth the size of daggers. From this cavernous hollow echoing with deep croaking belches darts a thick tongue the color of an angry bruise, darting forth to greedily snatch up flies, birds, and anything else that comes too near.\n\nThe Brood of Gogunta, the Swamp Kings, mobogos are the primeval paragons of boggard-kind. Huge and hungry, merging the features of gigantic toads and swampy dragons, mobogos lair in the deepest, oldest swamps of Golarion, where whole tribes of boggards serve their fickle, idiot whims.\n\nMost mobogos stand approximately 18 feet tall and weigh upward of 3 tons. A mobogo&apos;s loudest croaks cut through the humidity and underbrush of even the densest swamps and can be heard up to a mile away.\nEcology\n\nMobogos reside in the most primal swamps of Golarion, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for centuries. The crude religion of boggard-kind says that when the massive goddess Gogunta deposited her frogspawn in the muddy morass of Golarion&apos;s still-forming continents, the mobogo were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever since, these Swamp Kings have slept and fed, preying upon the beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic, dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their godly mother&apos;s return.\n\nFew mobogos exist even in the largest swamps. Although boggards claim mobogos are immortal and divine, in truth the creatures likely have lifespans measuring in centuries. Most mobogos never meet another of their kind, with the endless attentions of their boggard followers assuring the corpulent creatures rarely have any need to move from their sacred pools and marshy temples. Should two mobogos actually meet, however, the result is either a pitifully small cluster of frogspawn or a titanic battle of thrashing flesh and deafening croaks.\nHabitat &amp; Society\n\nFew mobogos exist that are not attended by tribes of boggards. Whether the toad-men and mobogos are actually related remains a widely debated question by scholars of other races. Boggards don&apos;t question the matter, however, holding the massive, warty beasts as the holy offspring of their foul swamp goddess, Gogunta. Mobogos remain silent on the matter, their crude intelligences caring little for matters of origins and philosophies. Instead, they care only for the endless sacrifices of food, victims, and pleasing swamp art brought to them by their obedient tribes.\n\nWhile boggard tribes blessed by the presence of a mobogo look to the fleshy beasts as leaders, the mandates of these monstrosities rarely seem profound or divine-mostly tending toward croaks for more food or sunnier thronemounds. In many tribes, a cunning boggard priest-king takes the role of liaison or attendant to the demigod and interprets his own agenda amid the beast&apos;s commands, croaks, and belches, becoming the obvious power behind and before the throne. On rare occasions, though-typically upon ingesting copious amounts of strange, poisonous dragonflies-mobogos go into lengthy dazes that can last days or months.\n\nUpon emerging, the Swamp Kings sometimes spout strange demands or blaze a path of devastation as they bound into the swamp. Boggards view these whims and migrations as commands from Gogunta herself, and zealously obey or follow the addled urges of their corpulent masters." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUAchaekek" name="Achaekek, The Mantis God" description="Achaekek is known to only a very few by its name-most know of this legendary assassin by its more common (although somewhat misleading) name of He Who Walks in Blood, or the Mantis God. Yet Achaekek is not a true god, but rather one of the first creatures given life by the gods. Even early on, long before mortal life came to dominate the Material Plane, some of the gods realized they would need an agent to carry out their divine justice, an agent they could send without compromising their own standing among the divine or dirtying their hands tending to immortals and demigods who could someday, if left alive, rise in power to a point to challenge them. Achaekek was created to be an assassin, a creature the gods could use against nascent enemies. Yet the gods did not wish to create a creature capable of being used against them, and thus created the Mantis God with the fundamental inability to act against the gods themselves-it can only slay those of demigod status or lower.\n\nThe faiths of Golarion disagree upon which of the gods created Achaekek. The churches of Asmodeus, Zon-Kuthon, Norgorber, Lamashtu, Rovagug, Gorum, Pharasma, and Calistria all have compelling arguments that point to their patrons as the source of the Mantis God. Others believe that it was not one god but a convocation of gods who gave the divine assassin its life. Still others believe that the gods who created Achaekek are themselves now dead, in some cases victims of their own murderous creation after their powers caused them to lose enough of their divinity to merely become immortals. One thing seems certain, though-although not all of Golarion&apos;s deities approve of the Mantis God, none have yet stepped in to unmake it. And to date, none have openly admitted to ever issuing a kill order to the Mantis God. It&apos;s almost as if Achaekek knows instinctively who or what must be slain, or perhaps is receiving its orders from a source beyond that of the pantheon itself. He Who Walks in Blood strikes only rarely, and its victims seem strange and inconsequential at times.\nMantis Cultists\n\nThe Red Mantis venerate the Mantis God as their patron, and just as He Who Walks in Blood cannot kill a God, so have the Red Mantis adopted this tradition to their ways such that they never assassinate a king or queen. A small concession, yet one that nevertheless works well in their defense, for many are the kings and queens who would not be as moved to oppose the cult in knowing that they cannot be touched. Most of the Red Mantis are rogues, fighters, or bards-many take levels in various prestige classes (the Red Mantis assassin being the most common). Yet a few of their number are actual clerics-particularly in their hidden fortress, the Crimson Citadel. A cleric of the Mantis God&apos;s favored weapon is the sawtooth sabre, and he has access to the domains of Death, Evil, Law, Trickery, and War.\n\nVictims\n\nIn past centuries countless demagogues and would-be deities have perished at Achaekek&apos;s scything claws.\n\nArrogant Marsis: Revered as the most beautiful man in the world during the early years of the Age of Enthronement, Marsis&apos;s beauty drew thousands of admirers away from revering the gods, finally drawing the ire of the gods and the claws of the Mantis God.\n\nYazanova: The murderous queen of the Tusk Mountains, Yazanova feasted on the hearts of a hundred rival chieftains, aspiring to the mantle of goddess of the North. She and her armies fell to the Mantis god in &#150;212 AR." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">
