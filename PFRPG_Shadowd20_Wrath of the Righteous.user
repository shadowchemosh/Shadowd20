  <thing id="ioS2TerScD" name="Terendelev&apos;s scales (Disguise)" description="These palm-sized silver dragon scales are unique items - essentially minor artifacts resulting from Terendelev&apos;s death on the Storm King&apos;s blade.\n\nEach of {i}Terendelev&apos;s scales{/i} grants a different power to the person who carries them. The powers granted do not function at all if more than one scale is carried. The powers of the four scales are listed below - any nonevil creature that handles a scale immediately understands its use.\n\n{b}Cloudwalking{/b}: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast {i}levitate{/i}. A pillar of roiling clouds rises below the levitating object or creature, growing and shrinking with the target&apos;s altitude. This pillar is 5 feet in diameter (regardless of the target&apos;s size) and provides concealment (20% miss chance) to any creature or object wholly contained within.\n\n{b}Disguise{/b}: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast {i}alter self{/i}. While disguised, the target gains a +4 bonus on all Bluff checks made against evil creatures.\n\n{b}Resistance{/b}: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast {i}resist elements{/i} - but only against electricity or cold.\n\n{b}Sacred Weaponry{/b}: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast {i}align weapon{/i}, but only to make a weapon lawful or good. Unlike a normal {i}align weapon{/i} spell, this effect can be cast on an unarmed strike or natural weapon.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}\nThe Storm King Khorramzadeh can destroy each of {i}Terendelev&apos;s scales{/i} merely by eating it." compset="Wondrous" replaces="ioTerScDis" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="iS2Radianc" name="Radiance" description="In 4692 ar, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the {i}wardstone{/i}. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword {i}Radiance{/i} for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she&apos;d rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with {i}Radiance{/i}, but Yaniel&apos;s body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel&apos;s death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.\n\n{i}Radiance{/i} was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel&apos;s death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a {i}+1 cold iron longsword{/i} that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin&apos;s deity&apos;s favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn&apos;t worship a deity, the weapon remains a {i}+1 longsword{/i}). Certain events and tasks can awaken {i}Radiance{/i}&apos;s latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged {i}holy avenger{/i} - these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.\n\nIn addition, {i}Radiance{/i} is a legendary item ({i}Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures{/i} 169) that bonds with a mythic paladin as soon as it is wielded in combat - in this adventure, {i}Radiance{/i} bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh&apos;s babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As {i}Radiance{/i} has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.\n\nIn the hands of Tural it acts as a +1 Cold Iron bastard sword.\n\n{b}DESTRUCTION{/b}\nA paladin must knowingly slay an angel with the blade, at which point the sword can be destroyed normally with damage." compset="MagicWep" uniqueness="useronce">
