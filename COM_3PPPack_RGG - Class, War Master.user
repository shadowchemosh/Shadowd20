  <thing id="cWarmaster" name="Warmaster" description="The war master is a warrior, leader, and strategist. As their name might suggest, typical war masters are first and foremost military commanders, able to both slay foes directly and to aid his allies by suggesting various tactics and maneuvers to maximize their gifts and minimize their weaknesses. But the art of war is far more than the ability to kill and lead killers, and war masters must also learn at least some skills of negotiation, espionage, and organization to dominate all aspects of armed conflict. Similarly, the lessons learned in battle can often be applied in less violent venues, allowing war masters to see how to gain advantage in a wide range of situations.\n\nMany war masters come from families of wealth and power, raised as lords as well as battle leaders. Noble families often push their junior scions to be war masters (as well as clerics or wizards) to ensure the family has the skills and power needed to defend its holdings and organize its forces. Noble war masters are often younger siblings with little chance of inheriting major holdings, or the offspring of trusted servants who are given an opportunity to become knights, squires, or royal guards. Almost as common are noble war masters whose families have lost their lands, forcing them to become skilled generals as they seek the skills, troops, and allies necessary to take back their homelands." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cWrmBatTsa" name="Battle Tactics" description="A war master is trained to use tactics to direct units and individuals to create beneficial combat situations that favor his allies. (A war master may always choose to count himself as one of his own allies, both for fulfilling conditions required by tactics, and for receiving the benefit of them.) He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st, this number increases by +2 rounds per day. Each round, the war master can make use of any one of the types of battle tactics that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.\n\nActivating a war master&#146;s tactic is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a war master&#146;s tactic from one effect to another requires the war master to end the previous tactic and start a new one as a standard action. A war master&#146;s tactic cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the war master is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise  prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A war master cannot have more than one battle tactic in effect in effect at one time.\n\nEach battle tactic has audible components and some also have visual components. Targets must be able to hear the war master for the tactics to have any effect, and such tactics are language dependent. A deaf war master has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a battle tactic. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts as one round against his daily limit. If a battle tactic has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the war master for the tactic to have any effect. A blind war master has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a battle tactic with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts as one round against his daily limit." compset="ClSpecial">

This can be attempted in combat, even against foes wishing the war master or his allies immediate harm. The DC for this special check is the same as the DC for improving the attitude of an NPC (see Diplomacy in the {i}Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook{/i} for more information). A successful check convinces a foe to stop attempting to harm the war master and his allies for 1d4 rounds, as long as the war master and his allies do nothing to improve their situation (or at least aren&#146;t caught doing anything). Thus neither the war master nor his allies may heal, move to better positions, cast spells, or ready equipment during the parley. In most cases if the war master and his allies don&#146;t offer concessions to a hostile foe, violence is renewed (even if negotiations seem to be going well) after the 1d4 rounds of parley." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="useronce">

If the equipment is some other piece of gear (such as a masterwork tool), the bonus applies to whatever skill or ability check the equipment normally grants a bonus to.

    <comment><![CDATA[Now, for the problem. You won't find masterwork status stored in the tags and fields. The custom armor/weapon items in Hero Lab use the "gizmo" mechanism, so that the custom armor/weapon can inherit all the stats of an existing weapon without having to make the user re-enter all of them for each custom item.

The tag and field reports don't report anything about the gizmo, just the final results.

What's worse is that masterwork isn't consistently recorded from thing to thing. For example, I can't figure out how to find something that can tell me that the Mithral Shirt specific item is masterwork.

I'll put on my to-do list to figure out a way to specifically tag all the masterwork items. But until then, I don't know a way to search for all the masterwork items on the character.

You're going to have to leave your ability as text only until then. Sorry.]]></comment>
