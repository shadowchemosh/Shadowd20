The god&apos;s priestesses, the Baccae, epitomize the rage and mindless violence that often comes of overindulgence.

Bowbe carries the greatsword {i}Bm&apos;fob{/i} in one hand and warhammer {i}Wytch-Killer{/i} in the other.\n\nBowbe revels in war and the slaughter of his foes. His battles against giants are legendary, as is his hatred for the undead, arcanists, lawyers, guardsmen, and most other civilized authority figures.\n\nUnlike other gods, Bowbe aids only those who take his name in vain. Thus it is not uncommon to hear berserkers cursing their god for his indifference as readily as they curse their foes. Bowbe only grants the raising of one of his followers if that follower immediately seeks blood vengeance against his killers. Bowbe grants no healing spells higher than 4th level.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} The loss of healing spells is not coded." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, and also negates a bard&apos;s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian&apos;s rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect.

  <thing id="spUmDomPer" name="Dominate Person" description="You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject&apos;s mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here,&quot; &quot;Go there,&quot; &quot;Fight,&quot; and &quot;Stand still.&quot; You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject&apos;s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can&apos;t communicate with you. You can&apos;t actually see through the subject&apos;s eyes, so it&apos;s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what&apos;s going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don&apos;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.{br}{br}Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it." compset="Spell" summary="Controls humanoid telepathically.">

The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.\n\nIn the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.\n\nBecause of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can&apos;t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It&apos;s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).\n\n{i}Shadow walk{/i} can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.

The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn&apos;t cause you to become grappled. Anyone in the effect&apos;s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell&apos;s DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter. If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.

Worship usually involves grave robbery and the animation and conscription of the newly dead to the forces of evil.\n{b}Typical Worshippers:{/b} Monsters, Undead and Evil Humanoids\n\nOrcus is a demon prince with - surprisingly enough - many human worshipers. He has a strange fascination with humans and their desire for power, possibly because it is this very flaw that causes them so frequently to seek that which he controls: power over death. Orcus is the lord of all undead and he resides in the Abyss in his Palace of Bones surrounded by a legion of vampires and liches.\n\nEvil, ruination and wanton destruction are his only goals. He is most often depicted as a bloated ram-headed, bat-winged monstrosity with cloven-hoofed goat legs. He wields the &quot;Wand of Orcus,&quot; a legendary skull-tipped obsidian rod that is rumored to slay any living thing it touches. Though mostly worshiped by the monstrous races, the ranks of Orcus&apos; human worshipers are swelling, as Orcus grants his followers power in large, liberal doses. It is not uncommon for Orcus to give relatively low-level priests command of vast numbers of undead to do his bidding. His symbol is either a demonic ramheaded skull (the most common), a representation of himself seated on his throne, or a depiction of his skull-tipped wand. His priests favor heavy, dark hooded robes and ornamental maces stylized to represent his skull-tipped wand." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

He is the vicious dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Making his home on the plane of Tarterus at the mouth of the vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows out of the Abyss, Tsathogga&apos;s main form is a colossally bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs and fingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul humors and fluids that leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He never moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking.\n\nTsathogga commands a host of evil creatures - notably evil aberrations and his own vile frog race, the tsathar (detailed in the {b}Necromancer Games{/b} module {b}{i}D1: The Tomb of Abysthor{/b}{/i}).  Thousands of fawning tsathar servants continuously bathe his body in fetid slime from the evil swamp, awaiting the divine bliss of being randomly devoured by him. His hatred of light and lack of human worshippers (though there are a few notable exceptions) mean that he is little known to surface races. He has had few organized centers of worship and no standardized holy symbol - each worshipper choosing its own way to best depict his deific vileness. Occasionally, tsathar priests of Tsathogga on Tarterus sculpt a small likeness of him out of foul chunks of solid waste from the Styx that harden into a vile green substance similar to soapstone when taken from that plane. Such items are prized as holy relics." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

Those who pray to Zors do so when no other god will answer them or when all other hope is lost. By the same token he is also the deity of great luck, as he escaped the bonds of the tree of life so too have his followers found themselves escaping fates worse than death. In reverence to his luck aspect the Zorsans hold a great weekly lottery collecting huge sums of money which are always paid to the lucky number holder lest the demigod exact some vengeance of unluckiness upon those who would corrupt the purpose of the game.\n\nProphets of Zors openly oppose ritual executions in ordered societies as cruel and unusual punishment.  They frequently are found performing the ceremony of the hanged man near gallows or other places of public execution. In this ritual one of their number is paraded before the jeering throngs by a noose, only to have the noose slip free, and the &quot;prisoner&quot; escape, symbolizing a second chance to do better in this life, lest one pay the ultimate price in the next." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

She was popular among humans until around 10,000 years ago when she gave up her life to prevent Orcus from conquering the Material Plane. She was normally depicted as an armored woman holding a kite shield with a benevolent but sad expression on her face. It was said she carried the sorrows of the world on her shoulders and later stated that she must have seen the fate that would befall her. Her principles were the protection and safety of civilized societies where individuals could grow and achieve their destinies without fear of sudden calamity or destruction. When she sacrificed herself, her siblings assumed her spheres of influence and incorporated her goals into their own. It is rumored, however, that a portion of her essence was released upon her death and became twisted with hate and vengeance for the end that she met and coalesced into a new deity that was the very antithesis of all she had stood for - Hel, Lady of Death and Pestilence. If Kel&apos;s church were somehow revived, it is certain that they would make eradication of that apostate faith as one of its top priorities. Her sacred animal is the lowly hedgehog for his innate protective abilities, and her faithful often repeat the ancient axiom, &quot;The fox knows many tricks; the hedgehog one good one.&quot;" compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
