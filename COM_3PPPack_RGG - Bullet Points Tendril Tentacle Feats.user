You may designate a single creature as a swift action, or up to six creatures as a move action. The tendril spell does not attack or ensnare such characters, though it may still impede their process. For example, if you designate a character to be safe from , a black tentacle spell you have cast the spell never attempts to grapple that character, but the area still qualifies as difficult terrain. As a swift action you may revoke this immunity from one creature, or revoke all the immunities you have designated.\n\nAdditionally, the tendril spell defends one creature of your choice within or adjacent to its area, granting that creature a shield bonus equal to half the level of the tendril spell. Changing which creature the spell defends is a swift action." compset="Feat" summary="You can prevent your tendril spells from attack you or your allies, and even have it defend" uniqueness="useronce">
