A creature does not take damage within the sarcophagus, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to cut its way out of the sarcophagus with a weapon must be able to penetrate the sarcophagus&apos;s hardness (hardness 5). The sarcophagus can swallow only one creature at any one time." compset="RaceCustom" uniqueness="useronce">
