    <info_history><![CDATA[
6/9/2013
-Fixed Sub-skills as HL timing for totals in skills was moved up.
-Fixed Sub-skills double penalty when the AllSkills Thing was used for giving a bonus/penalty to all skills.
    
1/26/2013
-Changed monk's "High Jump" to add to the Jump Sub-skill. Including the +20 for spending a Ki Point.

10/2/2012
-Added some situtational notes for Elven Magic.

6/13/2012
-Added new sub-skills called "Acrobatics (Balance)" and "Acrobatics (Tumbling)".

5/26/2012
-Added new sub-skill called "Survival (Lost)".
-Changed "Wayfinder" to give a bonus to "Survival (Lost)".

5/23/2012
-Changed "+4 to Survival when tracking by Scent" Racial Ability to give bonus to the sub-skill Survival (Track).
-Changed "Acrobatics (Jump)" Racial Ability to give a bonus to the sub-skill Acrobatics (Jump) skill.

3/25/2012
-Added new sub skill "Diplomacy (Gather Info)".
-Redid the procedure CalcSubSk to use the new Tag Group SubSkill that I added. This finally allows for a the procedure to now be fully generic. It pulls the parent Skill now through the SubSkill.? group tag.

3/20/2012
-Merged in Sub skills from the pirate campaign Razor Coast.

11/10/2011
-Added "Perception (Stone)" sub skill.
-Modified dwarven "Stonecunning" to add to new sub skill.
-New Procedure "CalcSubSk" Calculate Sub-Skill Generic total was added. This will help as the calculations for the skill bonuses will all be calculated in a single function now.
-New Procedure "CalcSubPer" Calculate Sub-Skill Percption total was added.
-New Procedure "CalcSubAcr" Calculate Sub-Skill Acrobatics total was added.

7/21/2011
-Fixed bug when both Armor and Shield is equipped when calculating Acrobatics(Jump).

6/26/2011
-Added Spellcraft(Magic Items) sub-skill.
-Added CL vs SR sub-skill.
-Modified Elven Magic to add to new Spellcraft(magic Items) skill.

2/25/2011
-Changed the timing on "Track" to allow other class abilities more time to override the abValue.

1/23/2010
-Fixed wording on "Perception(Sight)".

12/27/2010
-Modified "Ring of Jumping" to apply its bonus correctly to Acrobatics(Jump) checks.
-Modified "Ring of Improved Jumping" to apply its bonus correctly to Acrobatics(Jump) checks.
-Changed all the Sub Skills to NOT be associated with a Linked Attribute so that Buff Spells and magic items don't find these skills and add bonuses to them.  The bonus should be applied to the Parent skill then picked up by the sub-skill.

12/1/2010
-Modified "Boots of Striding and Springing" to apply its bonus correctly only to Acrobatics(Jump) checks.

11/27/2010
-Bug fixes for Acrobatics(Jump) for Mithral/Magical agile Breastplate armor.
-Added "Acrobatics(Jump)" skill that will auto-calc the correct Jump Value based on speeds greater/lesser than 20 and then include the base value from Acrobstics.
-Added a replace thing to the Agile Breastplate so that it will also only give a -1 ACP for Acrobatics(Jump) skills.
-Fixed Rogues Trapfinding so that it does NOT apply its bonus to ALL Disable Device checks.
-Added new skills: Disable Device(traps); Perception(traps). Both of these are manually added, but are set to be Sub-skills of the main skills Disable Device and Perception.  Really useful for rogue characters as their Trapfinding class ability will add into these two skills so that it is easier to see your total.
-Added new skill: Survival(Track). This will be correctly added to from the Ranger's Track class ability.
-Added new skill: Perception(Smell), Perception(Taste), Perceptin(Sight), Perception(Hearing), Perception(Touch).
-Found a better way to have a "in your face" error when putting skill ranks in Sub-skills or into Concentration.
-Changed "Canny Observer" rogue trait to apply its +4 bonus to Perception(Traps).
-Changed "Kobold's Neighbor" trait to apply its +2 bonus to Perception(Traps).]]></info_history>
