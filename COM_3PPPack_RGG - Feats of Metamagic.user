A chain spell affects the primary target normally then arcs to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level. You choose the secondary targets as you like but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target and no individual can be targeted more than once. You can choose fewer secondary targets than the maximum. \n\nSecondary targets of a chain spell suffer the full spell&#146;s effect, but make saving throws against a lower DC. If the chain spell deals\ndamage, the secondary targets may each attempt a Reflex saving throws against the spell&#146;s normal save DC &#150;2 with a successful\nsave resulting in half damage. For spells that do not directly deal damage, the save DCs for secondary targets are reduced by 4.\n\nFor example, a 10th-level wizard with a 17 Intelligence casts a chain blindness/deafness on a nearby goblin and can specify up to\nten secondary targets. The goblin, as primary target, must make a Fortitude save against DC 15, while those affected by the secondary arcs save against DC 11. A chain spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&#146;s actual level." compset="Feat" summary="You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fTrapSpell" name="Trap Spell" description="You can cast a spell into an object as a trap. \n\n{b}Prerequisites:{/b} Knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} A trap spell may only be cast on an object that can be opened and closed and has one (and only one) closure. Rather than going off immediately, the trap spell is held in stasis until it is set off. When someone other than you opens the object, the trap spell goes off. If the trap spell targets an area, you select the center of that area when casting the spell (that point must be relative to the object.centered on the object, centered 10 feet in front of the object, etc..rather than the location the spell is cast). If the trap spell targets one or more creatures, the creature opening the object becomes the target of the trap spell.\n\nThe item into which a trap spell is cast is not harmed when the trap spell goes off. You can use the trap spell infused object without discharging the trap spell. While casting a trap spell, you can also create a password that, if spoken aloud, will allow others to use the object without discharging the trap spell. A trap spell trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A knock spell does not bypass a trap spell. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.\n \nMagic traps such as a trap spell are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (and only a rogue) can use the Perception skill to find a trap spell and use Disable Device to bypass it (though the trap spell will reactivate once the item is closed again). The DC in each case is 25 + the trap spell&#129;s original spell level. A trap spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spells actual level." compset="Feat" summary="You can cast a spell into an object as a trap." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fWeakSpell" name="Weak Spell" description="You can prepare weaker versions of spells as lower-level versions.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} Only spells that deal hit point damage and have no other effect can be cast as weak spells. A weak spell deals half as much damage as normal. Weak spells cannot also have metamagic feats added that increase their damage or save DCs. A weak spell uses up a spell slot one level lower than the spell&#146;s actual level (minimum 1st level). Unlike most metamagic feats, a spell prepared as a weak spell calculates its save DCs using the new, lower spell level.\n\nFor example, Davor is a 9th level half&#150;orc wizard with an 18 Intelligence. He prepares a weak fireball as a 2nd level spell. When he casts the spell, he rolls 9d6 for damage (rolling a total of 30) and it has a save DC of 16 (10 + 2 for modified spell level + 4 Intelligence modifier). Since the fireball was a weak spell he halves that damage to 15 (and targets that make successful Reflex saves take half that, or 7 points of damage).\n\nIf Davor had prepared a weak still fireball as a 3rd level spell, he would still calculate its save DC as a 2nd level spell." compset="Feat" summary="You can prepare weaker versions of spells as lower-level versions." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fCascadeSp" name="Cascade Spell" description="You can cast multiple low-level spells as a single higher-level spell.\n\n{b}Prerequisites:{/b} Dex 13. \n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} Only spells that target only you and have a duration of at least 1 round can be cast as cascade spells. You can prepare multiple spells as a single cascade spell, as long as all spells are 3rd level or lower, and the total spell levels do not exceed 4. The\nduration of all the cascade spells is equal to the shortest duration for all the spells. A cascade spell uses up a spell slot one level\nhigher than the total level of all the spells in the cascade. It has a casting time equal to the longest casting time of all the spells in\nthe cascade. \n \nFor example, Riona is a 9th level dwarf druid. She prepares a cascade spell that includes jump, longstrider, and barkskin&#151;4 total levels of spells&#151;as a single 5th level spell. The cascade barkskin/jump/longstrider uses a 5th level spell slot, takes a single action\nto cast, gives her the benefit of all three spells, and has a duration of one minute per level." compset="Feat" summary="You can cast multiple low-level spells as a single higher-level spell." uniqueness="useronce">
