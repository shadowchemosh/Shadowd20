  <thing id="iouDemscpe" name="The Demonscope" description=" Of all the legends concerning the mysterious origin of the Demonscope, perhaps the account documented in the Scrolls of Llayoen the Blind are most accurate. Among other tales, the scrolls relate the following information.\n\nWhen St. Clydwell first arrived in the ruins of what had been Sarkoris, the former champion of Aroden who then followed Iomedae gathered with his disciples and fellow pilgrims in the town of Gravehearst. Although they survived the perilous journey and were at last ready to confront the heart of their remorseless foe, their losses were unspeakable. The lands they had traveled through lay torn and festering beneath tattered shreds of reality. Even as they breathed, ravenous fiends greedily devoured the very essence of the Material Plane.\n\nThe great shamans of Gravehearst, which was already on the brink of falling to the demonic hordes, salvaged what little hope they had left and gathered to greet the pilgrims. For months, they had toiled over a powerful scrying device with which they hoped to safeguard their lands. Sculpted from a great onyx orb of pure magic, the device seemed to possess an unearthly sentience, but none among them had the power to awaken it.\n\nWhen they placed the Demonscope before Clydwell, the knight somberly accepted it as his duty that he should claim the artifact and defend it to the death. Then, as his life passed he would allow his essence to enter into the Demonscope. Upon his passing, care of the Demonscope would pass to his three most loyal disciples: Niamar, Guenarog, and Arymril.\n\nSoon after, Gravehearst also fell to the demons, and true to his word, Clydwell fought to his death. Pitted against a powerful fiend, the two grappled in an epic battle that climaxed with a tremendous explosion that sent a ripple through reality, momentarily banishing the demons from Gravehearst. Thus the salvation of Mendev was born from a union between the ancient barbarian magic and the power of the pilgrims' faith. Unfortunately, the triumph was short-lived, and soon the demon armies returned in force and seized the shattered city.\n\nFollowing Clydwell's death, his disciples carried his ashes and the Demonscope to a small fortification known as Corksberg Keep, which they renamed in his honor. There, the trio founded an order of paladins known as the Holy Sentinels to help protect the Demonscope. Although the original disciples have long since passed on, the order maintains a strong tradition of appointing new Sentinels in hopes that all remains secured.\n\nRising from the floor of the heart chamber is a well of arcane power. Filling the well to within a couple inches of the top is an inky black liquid that drinks in the light. Within this liquid, shadowy landscapes rise and fall sprinkled with dozens of tiny red blips. Evenly spaced around the side of the well are three niches, each containing a bone fragment within an ornate reliquary.\n\nThe Demonscope serves three crucial functions. First, it serves as a potent scrying device focused solely on demons. It automatically senses the location of any demon in a 5-mile radius, bypassing any spell resistance they possess. Second, it focuses divine energy to power the wardstones, a series of smaller artifacts that together create a physical barrier against demons (see below). Finally, the Demonscope creates a massive dimensional lock effect that extends in a 250-mile radius around Clydwell Keep. Although this effect does not prevent demons from entering the Worldwound from the Abyss, it does prevent them from teleporting from the Worldwound out into the surrounding lands, and it prevents anyone from teleporting into Mendev. The Demonscope serves a vital role in containing the demons in the Worldwound, and preventing them from overrunning Mendev.\n\nTo safeguard the Demonscope, its care passed into the able hands of St. Clywell's three most powerful disciples. Along the pedestal, three Celestial glyphs allowed them to focus their own power to control the device, each representing the sentinel's personal virtue. Only when all three sentinels were present could the artifact function properly.\n\nWhen the first of the sentinels died, arcane artificers took the bone from his right forearm and forged it into a magical key to assure the continued activation of the Demonscope. Each of the Sentinels passed in turn and from their forearms were carved two more shards. Shards were then passed to new protectors dedicated to safeguarding the people and protecting the Demonscope. For years, the shards have been passed down through the order, bestowed upon generations of successors. Each shard is a 6-inch fragment of magically petrified bone, burnished black and polished to a high sheen, and placed within a crystal reliquary. The surface is intricately scrimshawed with sacred blessings dedicated to a specific sentinel. Along the rim of the Demonscope pedestal are three sacred glyphs set before three sockets. Carved in Celestial, the three glyphs represent Truth, Valor, and Sacrifice; one for each of the virtues for which the original Holy Sentinels stood: Niamar for Truth, Guenarog for Valor, and Arymril for Sacrifice.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}\nThe Demonscope requires constant attention and maintenance in order to function. Powered by a combination of intrinsic magical power and the magical potency of the demon that is imprisoned within it, the artifact requires that a careful balance of power be maintained at all times, and the demon kept in check. It takes the combined efforts of three strong-willed paladins to maintain control over the demon. If one of them fails, the demon eventually overpowers the other two and begin to corrupt the artifact itself, although this takes several days. The easiest way to destroy the artifact, however, is to remove the bone shards. Without the shards, the paladins are unable to control the demon, and it only takes a few hours for it to break free from its prison." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="iouFaithOr" name="Faith Orb" description=" This brass orb is a bit larger than a human fist. It is covered with symbols of goodness and law and thick studs. If used as an improvised weapon, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and serves as a good weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The faith orb is activated when a special stud is depressed (usually marked by a different metal). Activating the orb is a standard action, but the orb may be thrown as a ranged touch attack (10-foot range increment) with the same action that is used to activate it. At the end of the action or when it hits its target, it triggers a flame strike centered on the orb. Creatures caught in the blast area suffer 9d6 damage as the spell, or half with a DC 17 Reflex save. The faith orb is consumed in the process.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Craft Wondrous Item, flame strike; Cost 1,125 gp" compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="iouHourShd" name="Hourglass of Shadows" description="Created by the demon-hag sorceress Agnok, the hourglass of shadows is a foul and cursed artifact capable of grinding goodly souls into malevolent and restless shadows. The unwieldy device weighs as much as two men and rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a sand-filled central chamber of smoke-colored, etched glass. The foul device transforms the charred remains of mortals into shadows. To operate the device, the owner must place the ashes of the individual into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times, the contents are emptied into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water. After 24 hours, this clay pot becomes a shadow urn. The hourglass must be carefully aligned before it can be used, which requires a DC 30 Spellcraft check.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}\nThe hourglass of shadows is particularly vulnerable to spells with the light descriptor, and if any such spell that is cast on it renders it inoperative for one day per level of the spell. Casting sunburst on the hourglass at noon on a sunny, cloudless day instantly and permanently renders it completely nonmagical." compset="Wondrous">

The prod itself is non-functional, but provides the water scorpion with excellent balance. The water scorpion functions as a +1 weapon that magically produces a stream of holy water with a range of 30 feet each time it is fired. The stream strikes its opponent as a ranged touch attack that deals 2d4+1 points of damage to undead and evil outsiders. To other creatures it is harmless. Only one stream might be fired each round, but there are rumors of water scorpions of speed created from the original.\n\nAnyone proficient with crossbows may use a water scorpion without penalty." compset="MagicWep">
