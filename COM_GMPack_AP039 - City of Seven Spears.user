  <thing id="rAP39NmrDn" name="The Nightmare Dancer" description="Native to the fecund jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, dream spiders are among the many wondrous and terrifying creatures to stalk the thick tropical forests of Garund. Their name among the people native to the region, Jalkara Kal, is the name of the mythic Prince of Dreams revered by many tribes of river people. The Sutra of the Ancients tells of Jalkara Kal&apos;s transformation into a spider after Mevenga the Leopard, Prince of Ravages, convinced the All-King that Jalkara was a traitor. The All-King later learned of Mevenga&apos;s treachery, but had employed powers so rancorous against Jalkara that the punitive transformation could never be undone. The best the All-King could do was to return Jalkara&apos;s power over dreams and visions to him in his new arachnid form. The dream spiders are Jalkara&apos;s brood, and depending on which tribe you ask, they have menaced or blessed the peoples of the jungle since time immemorial. The power of their venom, to gift the bitten with visions, is widely valued, but many fear the poisonous boon, believing the visions to be of some future doom. Some tribes hunt the Jalkara Kal viciously, driving the creatures from their lands. Foreigners find the narcotic bliss that accompanies a dream spider&apos;s bite irresistible, and trappers both native and foreign now sell the strange monsters for three times their weight in gold to traders who bring the venomous beasts to Cheliax, Absalom, Varisia, and other cosmopolitan and decadent ports of call. Some are even rumored to spin their iridescent webs, which carry a similar poison, into an intoxicating silk cloth.\n\nDream spiders lurk in dark places. In the jungles they spin their webs in the thick branches of the canopy above, skulk under mossy growths, or hide among fungal shelves jutting from the giant trees of the Mwangi. Thanks to the widespread and often illegal trade of Jalkara Kal, a number of these venomous beasts also infest many of Golarion&apos;s largest cities. There they hide on rafter beams, in attic corners, under moldy blankets in cellars, up unused chimneys, in the cabinets of abandoned kitchens, and like environs.\n\nDream spiders lay egg in lightless places and prefer to plant their brood in books above all. Libraries are often infested with dream spiders, and some sages claim great tales of history are the Jalkara Kal&apos;s favorite nest. The fact that the Prince of Dreams is also known as the Father of History either lends credence to the sages&apos; tales, or perhaps inspires them to invent stories of spider-spewing tomes of past lore. More practical scholars, however, are quick to point out that the pages of books are easily chewed into the paste that constitutes the spider&apos;s nesting material. Dream spiders grow very quickly, as if time cannot hold them back from whatever dire and poisonous ambitions they harbor.\n\nTreasure\n\nDream spiders are a treasure unto themselves. A live specimen is worth 50 gp, while a typical egg cluster is worth 100 gp (young dream spiders are difficult to raise in captivity, though). Dream spider webbing is worth 50 gp per nest, although care must be taken in handling the stuff. Silk spun from dream spider webs is particularly valued in the crafting of clothing intended to bear illusion magic.\n\nThe primary value of a dream spider, though, is to an alchemist who has mastered the craft of brewing shiver from dream spider venom. A single dose of shiver is worth 10 gp, although actual street value can sometimes exceed five times that amount in areas where drug trades are tightly controlled or illegal. In Korvosa, a dose of shiver typically sells for 25 gp-enough that a life of petty theft can just barely keep an addict in ready supply.\n\nVariants\n\nSeveral sub-species of Jalkara Kal are known to exist-the specimen described above is merely the most populous breed, and the easiest to catch.\n\nPerhaps the next most common variant is the deatheye dancer. These mottled black and purple dream spiders are usually bulkier than the common breed, and their fangs are noticeably larger as well (bite damage 1d6). The bite of a death-eye dancer also causes a victim to shuffle and spasm wildly, almost as if dancing-this venom deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage in addition to the normal Wisdom damage.\n\nRarer are the much larger and more dangerous nightmare spiders-Medium-sized dream spiders with black and red markings whose venom causes three times the amount of Wisdom damage on the initial save and paralysis for 2d6 hours if the secondary save is failed.\n\nShiver\n\nEnigmatic and eerily beautiful, dream spiders are now a hot commodity on the streets of Korvosa, where it&apos;s said their venom shows some the future.\n\nVenom milked directly from a dream spider is potent, but not particularly habit-forming. When the venom is boiled in a mixture of water, alcohol, and webbing gathered from dream spider nests, the result is an addictive drug called &#147;shiver.&#148; The process of creating the drug is complex, requiring a DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check to produce a single dose.\n\nShiver is taken by mouth, and its effects are swift. The drinker must make a DC 10 Fortitude save to resist taking 1 point of Wisdom damage. A minute later, he must save again or lapse into a comatose state for 1d4 hours, during which he experiences vivid, bizarre dreams. Each additional dose of shiver taken within 24 hours increases the DC to resist by +1 and the duration of the coma by 1d4 hours.\n\nShiver is extremely habit-forming. Each time a creature takes the drug, he can resist addiction with a DC 10 Fortitude check. An addicted character must make a DC 15 Fortitude save each week he doesn&apos;t use shiver to avoid taking 1d10 points of Wisdom damage. A character who makes two of these saving throws in a row recovers from his addiction." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="raAP39DmW" name="Dream Web" description="Creatures with the web ability can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature&apos;s HD + creature&apos;s Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a &#150;4 penalty.\n\nWeb spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it and DR 5/-.\n\nA creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.\n\nA dream spider can spin webs just like a monstrous spider of the same size but its webs carry an iridescent hue, making them easy to notice (Spot DC 15). Any animal, humanoid, giant, or monstrous humanoid that comes in contact with these webs experiences strange hallucinations, taking 1 point of Wisdom damage per round of contact. A DC 11 Fortitude save negates this damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they create a spread of poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to all creatures in the area (not just to those susceptible to contact with webs as listed above). A DC 11 Fortitude save halves this damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for only a single round before dissipating harmlessly. The save DC is Constitution-based." compset="RaceSpec" summary="You can set or toss webbing.">
