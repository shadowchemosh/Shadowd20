  <thing id="ruEmkrah" name="Emkrah" description="The misbegotten offspring of the god of destruction, emkrahs are the Spawn of Rovagug that will never be. Taking their names from the Kelish word for wrongful births, these horrendous beings hatch from the repulsive egg sacks known as Rough Seeds, grotesque expulsions of Rovagug himself. While not all seeds hatch, those that do draw upon the life force of destructive beings nearby, using such creatures&apos; essences to fuel their grotesque metamorphoses. Once hatched, emkrahs never develop into full-fledged Spawn of Rovagug, but their smaller size and strange births do nothing to curb their destructive natures, which mark them as true scions of the god of disaster.\n\nEmkrahs vary widely in size and form, with many having excess tentacles, strange colorations, multiple eyes, and other abnormalities. Most, however, measure 10 feet tall from their tentacles to the top of their gelatinous shells and weigh approximately 400 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nEmkrahs experience a strange and doubtful lifecycle, with only a fraction of those flung forth by Rovagug finding the foul spark they require to develop. These strange abominations begin their lives as grotesque ejecta or terrible fossils, so-called Rough Seeds, emitted by the imprisoned god of destruction. While most are crushed or consumed by the raging god, some make it to the surface, falling upon the scarred wasteland surrounding the infamous Pit of Gormuz. Once flung from the depths, most Rough Seeds are simply buried, or else shrivel and rot away from exposure to the harsh environs. Occasionally, though, either by luck or the attentions of the cult of Rovagug, these leaking black egg clusters reach another fate, carried away from the pit to undergo a grotesque metamorphosis.\n\nWhile worshipers of the god of wrath claim that Rough Seeds bear within them the embryos of undeveloped Spawn of Rovagug, the eggs hold no ability to produce such behemoths, lacking some fundamental divine stimulation. In truth, they lack the ability to produce any sort of life alone. But to some beings, creatures of unrestrained destruction and rage-typically aberrations, foul outsiders, and powerful vermin-the Rough Seeds possess an irresistible draw. As such beings come near the seeds, something flares within. Slowly, over several days of close proximity, something grows within the Rough Seed. After this metamorphosis, the egg unravels its slick, wet shell, having become an emkrah. In most cases, the link between the emkrah and the destructive being that so inspired it deteriorates, but in some instances, the beasts become obsessed, even fundamentally fused with one another. The reasons and results of such connections are vague and vary, as different beasts-especially aberrant ones and outsiders-react to these lesser offspring of the god of destruction in often strange and little-understood ways. However a being might concern itself over an emkrah, though, these gelatinous horrors never reciprocate, and while they might prove cooperative one moment, they might be feasting upon the flesh of their indirect parent in the next.\n\nEmkrahs have strange and insatiable hungers. While all desire flesh, some seek out valuable stones, holy animals, or even certain types of people. After a time, all emkrahs seek the essences of living creatures to devour. Rather than just dissolving its victim&apos;s flesh, the beast manages to capture and fundamentally destroy the being&apos;s soul. Instantly, upon finishing this meal, an emkrah&apos;s amorphous shell hardens and its tentacles retract. The beast spends several days in this state before emerging a size category larger and possessing either DR 10/good or regeneration 5.\n\nAlthough the cult of Rovagug&apos;s few records are vague on the matter, these writings suggest that the oldest and largest emkrahs play some role in creating true Spawn of Rovagug.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAlthough typically only found near the infamous Pit of Gormuz in central Casmaron, emkrahs find their way throughout Golarion with little effort of their own. The cult of Rovagug sees in these grotesque eggs a living connection to their imprisoned deity and covet them, doing much to keep them safe and assure their strange metamorphosis. Finding and fertilizing a Rough Seed is a daunting and ultimately unlikely task, making emkrahs exceptionally rare creatures, even for those who have long sought to hatch such beasts.\n\nUpon hatching into the world, emkrahs care little for their surroundings, knowing only their terrible hunger. Set loose, these terrors prefer to lair in violent climes, seemingly attracted to places of great volcanic activity, where earthquakes frequently occur, or even lands in the grip of social disorder." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruHadhayos" name="Hadhayosh" description="Created by a deity of the forge in ancient times, hadhayoshes tower over the lands, symbols of the power of the gods and the fury of the desert. While they look similar to oxen in general shape, these massive beasts have skin like beaten brass and flames that leap from their heads and backs in radiant manes. They are typically docile creatures motivated primarily by the urge to sleep, reproduce, and eat, in that order, though a certain wanderlust afflicts the beasts, causing them to roam over vast territories. When angered, hadhayoshes become ferocious, striking out with rage at any creature that would dare to challenge them. They are not accustomed to lesser creatures causing trouble for them, though they often find themselves prey for other giants such as dragons.\n\nStrangely uniform in size, as if measured to divine specifics, all adult hadhayoshes stand 52 feet tall and weigh exactly 57 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough physically similar to a titanic ox, a hadhayosh&apos;s body generates far greater heat and grows dense metal instead of normal horns or hooves. Although gigantic creatures, these massive oxen require surprisingly little food to survive and seem to be able to flourish by drinking any liquid. Some witnesses tell of seeing adult hadhayoshes drinking from volcanoes, lapping up magma thirstily without regard to the heat or chunks of cooling stone. Young hadhayoshes are rarely seen, the creatures&apos; low fecundity in part accounting for their rarity. When spotted, though, such youths appear much like full-grown gorgons with gleaming brass skin. Although appearing similar, little else connects the two species, though this hardly lessens the number of strange theories regarding their origins.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nHadhayoshes graze lightly over large territories, preferring warm, hilly regions and deserts. They enjoy areas with healthy amounts of foliage on which to dine, favoring trees over grasses because they are much easier to reach from their height. They travel frequently, sometimes staying in one locale for weeks, then spontaneously migrating hundreds of miles. Whenever possible they wait for at least a year before returning to the same area, seeming to dislike even passing through areas they&apos;ve previously walked. Few obstacles serve as barriers to hadhayoshes, with some even walking between continents in their travels.\n\nMany peoples believe sighting a hadhayosh is lucky, as the beasts so rarely return to regions they&apos;ve visited before. When one of these fantastic creatures draws near, whole villages might turn out to watch it graze. More than once, though, such wonder has quickly turned to terror as the unmindful beast tramples the homes of its adorers.\n\n{b}Legends of the Hadhayosh{/b}\nNumerous stories surround hadhayoshes. Some believe that the appearance of these creatures nearby is an omen of good luck, wealth, and prosperity, while others try to chase these creatures out of the area for fear that they bring wildfires and destruction. The tales of many desert peoples tell that the great oxen are particularly sensitive to the whims and wishes of the gods, and often work divine will. Due to this supposed divine connection, the princes of many lands place especial value on hadhayoshes, greatly rewarding those who capture these titans for their menageries. In some lands, it is said that the blood of a hadhayosh is divine and can bestow the divine right to rule, making them dangerous quarry for rebels, princes, and other would-be rulers. More than a few sultanates force royal offspring to seek out and slay a hadhayosh to prove who among them has the greatest right to rule. While in modern disputes over rulership the &#147;hadhayosh&#148; might be some rare symbolic icon, few signs of worth prove more convincing than the corpse of a true hadhayosh.\n\n{i}The Burning Herd:{/i} The stories of several cultures tell of powerful gods or demigods who possess vast herds of hadhayoshes. Symbols of strength, these beast pull the plows in these deities&apos; celestial fields, draw their mighty carriages, and dig paths for new rivers and oceans. Many tales tell of heroes who provoked the ire of the gods by stealing their favored beasts, or their favor by returning those lost. The Iron Lord Gorum in particular is known to favor these beasts, using a great team of them to turn many of the gears that power his great forge.\n\n{i}Hush:{/i} The greatest legend surrounding hadhayoshes claims that their bodies are infused with divine power and that, when properly prepared with the rare herb haoma, they create an elixir called hush that grants eternal life. For this reason alone, hadhayoshes have been hunted to near extinction, though few claim to know the exact formula for creating this incredible draught. It is said only the gods know how to prepare hush and divulge these secrets of its creation to those they seek to test. Some mischievous deities, though, might let the secret fall into the hands of the unfit, delighting in seeing foolish mortals come to terrible ends beneath the hooves of a hadhayosh.\n\n{b}Riding a Hadhayosh{/b}\nHadhayoshes are stubborn animals and, under most situations, refuse to allow even the most skilled handler to ride them. However, a suitable display of divine power impresses these creatures, changing their typical attitude of indifferent to helpful. To do this, a cleric or paladin must channel power through his holy symbol great enough to affect a 10 HD undead creature. A cleric with the Glory, Fire, Strength, or Sun domain gains a +2 bonus on this check (having multiple domains does not cause the bonus to stack). This show of divine might awes a hadhayosh and convinces it to lower its heat ability. Once so compelled, it will allow the character and up to 11 allies to ride it, though the creature will not attack or otherwise go out of its way to aid its riders." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruRukh" name="Rukh" description="Rukhs are a gigantic, divergent species of foul-tempered, vulture-like rocs, most recognizable by their two featherless heads. In addition to having two deadly heads to feed, these ravenous avians prove exceptionally alert in their endless hunt for food-both living beasts and carrion. These repulsive birds of prey typically glide high above the desert, watching for creatures that might provide a suitable amount of food for them and their young. Horses, camels, and humanoids passing below often attract their attention, though they are careful to avoid creatures of roughly the same size or that most likely would be too powerful for them to best.\n\nA typical adult rukh stands nearly 35 feet tall with a wingspawn of over 60 feet. Although often starving, they can weigh upward of 800 pounds. Juvenile rukhs usually stand about 10 feet tall, with a relatively small wingspan of near 18 feet. Most weigh about 200 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nRukhs are among the deadliest opportunistic hunters of the deserts. Hatching from large gray eggs, they emerge frail and starving. While rukh parents feed their newborns for a few months, their offspring quickly take to the air and begin hunting in groups along with other clutch mates. Many have compared young rukhs to vultures, with one major exception: vultures wait for their prey to die and then feast on the carcasses, while young rukhs have no qualms about finishing the job themselves so that they can start searching for their next meal. As a result, tired travelers rightfully panic when they look to the skies and see a flock of large, two-headed birds circling overhead.\n\nDespite the menace that they pose, young rukhs rarely live to adulthood. If water is the currency of the desert, food is the luxury item, and young rukhs are highly sought after as a source of food by both beasts and desert dwellers. It is not uncommon for some travelers to appear intentionally weak so that they can lure in one or more young rukhs, and then kill them for sustenance. One bird is enough to feed a group of 10 adults for several days, or until the meat spoils, whichever comes first. While the meat is not as tasty as poultry or other domesticated birds, their ability to feed numerous people makes a freshly slain carcass quite valuable in the depths of the desert, where they can be used to feed whole caravans for days. An average-sized slain young rukh can be worth nearly 30 gp in many markets.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nRukhs prefer warm desert climates. They typically glide at high altitudes until they spot horses or camels passing below, then dive down to attack them. Small caravans and travelers also often find themselves on the menu. Too large to nest in trees, rukhs typically nest at high perches on mountains and cliff sides. It is not uncommon for a rukh to capture prey and then fly a hundred miles or more to its lair, and some prey find themselves snatched from hot deserts only to be consumed far away atop snowcovered peaks.\n\nCompared to rocs, rukhs are considerably rarer, their numbers amounting to about a quarter that of the great raptors. Likewise, they are not as widely known as rocs, except in the arid areas where they are common and pose a significant threat. In the wastelands where they are known, though, locals often make use of their feathers and tough skins in a variety of manners-sources of shade, thatching for roofs, or even grim decorations." compset="Race">

One bird is enough to feed a group of 10 adults for several days, or until the meat spoils, whichever comes first. While the meat is not as tasty as poultry or other domesticated birds, their ability to feed numerous people makes a freshly slain carcass quite valuable in the depths of the desert, where they can be used to feed whole caravans for days. An average-sized slain young rukh can be worth nearly 30 gp in many markets.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nRukhs prefer warm desert climates. They typically glide at high altitudes until they spot horses or camels passing below, then dive down to attack them. Small caravans and travelers also often find themselves on the menu. Too large to nest in trees, rukhs typically nest at high perches on mountains and cliff sides. It is not uncommon for a rukh to capture prey and then fly a hundred miles or more to its lair, and some prey find themselves snatched from hot deserts only to be consumed far away atop snowcovered peaks.\n\nCompared to rocs, rukhs are considerably rarer, their numbers amounting to about a quarter that of the great raptors. Likewise, they are not as widely known as rocs, except in the arid areas where they are common and pose a significant threat. In the wastelands where they are known, though, locals often make use of their feathers and tough skins in a variety of manners-sources of shade, thatching for roofs, or even grim decorations." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruMiengu" name="Miengu" description="Miengus are water spirits who typically dwell in desert oases, jungle rivers, and along tropical coasts. They consider themselves the protectors and healers of the weak and innocent, among whom they count peaceful fey, pools of pure water, serene vistas, natural gardens, and even the smallest of animals and flowers. They combat destructive races like ogres, goblins, and sahuagin wherever they encounter them, waging private crusades against their predations. Some claim lush oases, hidden coves, or reefs of particular beauty as their personal territories, guarding them viciously against any they perceive as interlopers.\n\nA typical miengu stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs several hundred pounds, their bodies consisting primarily of water.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMiengus are spirits of nature and share the winsome beauty and caprice of their fey cousins, but also prove serious and devoted to the defense of the wild. While similar to nymphs and dryads in their dedication to protecting nature, miengus are not physically tied to the lands they protect. Usually solitary creatures, these beings of living water take the forms of beautiful women, typically with overly wide smiles and either wild or no hair. Their open countenances can change swiftly, though, as they are a passionate race, just as quick to anger and vengeance as they are to laughter and love.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThese watery fey might occupy all manner of aquatic environs. Although most seem to favor desert oases and tropical coasts, miengus have also been sighted along shoals and rocky seashores, from cold arctic reaches to warm seas.\n\nMiengus often disguise their lairs with hallucinatory terrain to divert would-be intruders and allow them a chance to observe and determine people&apos;s intentions. Miengus living in oases may hide the oasis under an illusion of sand or create a false mirage to lead evildoers into danger, revealing the oasis only to those whom they deem worthy, while coastal miengus create phantom shoals or hide actual reefs to shipwreck the wicked, revealing the true path only to those of good heart. Miengus use similar tricks to confound their monstrous enemies, backing up their illusions with control water, summoned allies, or natural hazards and predators.\n\nWhile never entirely predictable, most miengus devote themselves to rooting out and destroying evil and bringing hope and rescue to those in need. The lairs of such beneficent water spirits sometimes become sites of pilgrimages for those seeking healing, blessing, or respite. Miengus often adopt stretches of water as their homes and fiercely defend their territory and the creatures who live therein, sometimes going so far as to adopt whole tribes of locals. Such relationships between these water fey and native sentient creatures rarely end well, though. While miengus-who measure their lifespans in centuries-might adopt a band of devoted nature worshipers who pay her and her protected lands great respect, the children of such a community often prove less dutiful as generations pass, eventually driving off the heartbroken fey. Thus, while many stories fill the chronicles of exotic cultures- particularly in Garund-few living in modern times claim to have ever seen a miengu firsthand." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruCoeurl" name="Coeurl" description="Lean and deadly, the animalistic appearance of the alien coeurls belies a keen intelligence and the tempered patience of a masterful hunter. Although similar in form to a wiry jungle cat, coeurls&apos; forelegs are longer than their rear, giving the shadowy-skinned, hairless creatures a more elevated posture than a common feline. Rather than ears, bundles of wavering antennae extend from either side of their heads, delicate organs capable of detecting sounds and other, more enigmatic sensations. A coeurl&apos;s most distinguishing trait is the pair of powerful black tentacles that extend from its shoulders, each ending in a cluster of flexible, barb-like digits capable of manipulating objects just as nimbly as a human hand.\n\nA typical coeurl stands approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and about 8 feet long, with a densely muscled body weighing around 650 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCoeurls are not native to Golarion, but have adapted well. Sages speculate that the deceptive creatures came to this world thousands of years ago via the ancient and mysterious portals that connect the various planets of the solar system. However, while the deadly felines have been encountered on other worlds-notably on Castrovel and Dykon, one of the moons of Bretheda-none of these populations seem significant enough to suggest the creatures&apos; place of origin. Thus, some suspect that coeurls hail from some place beyond Golarion&apos;s solar system, and have traveled throughout the stars and planes in search of creatures capable of providing them with sustenance. While intelligent, coeurls prove notoriously difficult to communicate with, in part due to the strange method of electrical manipulation that typifies their native language, but largely because most seem disinterested in talking with creatures they view as food.\n\nAlthough built like deadly feline predators, coeurls require more than mere animal flesh to survive, their strange physiologies being dependant on a poorly understood element they call id. Produced by and contained within living creatures-primarily within bones-this id nourishes coeurls just as food and water do most terrestrial beings, and without it, the tentacled felines starve and die. Seemingly unique throughout creation in their desire for this sustenance, coeurls mercilessly hunt all manner of creatures to sate their need for this unusual element. Harvesting id proves just as fatal and gory as an attack by a jungle cat, but coeurls seem to care little about the lives they extinguish in their feeding. Regardless of how much they consume, coeurls never prove completely sated, the natives of Golarion possessing id energy in amounts likened to drops of moisture collected from fog, hardly enough to sustain thirsty creatures used to drinking from eternal fountains.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nNo environment on Golarion seems to perfectly suit coeurls, leaving most irritable and frustrated. Those who deign to communicate with sentient beings complain that the world doesn&apos;t &#147;pulse,&#148; lacking some inherent energy coeurls find favorable. Those rare individuals who hunt on Golarion tend to linger in areas of frequent thunderstorms or in places known for strange electrical properties-such as some of the Darklands&apos; mysterious vaults or high desert mountains-but endure discomfort in their hunts for id.\n\nDue to their extreme rarity, coeurls infrequently encounter one another. Yet, beyond the mere happenstance of meeting others of their race, the alien hunters seem to actively avoid their own kind. While the cunning creatures might simply not wish to compete against their brethren for Golarion&apos;s sparse id resources, it&apos;s also possible that the strange predators don&apos;t wish to be tempted by their kin and the copious id others of their kind likely possess. In either case, coeurls on Golarion rarely approach one another, their isolationist tendencies overriding any racial imperative for companionship or reproduction.\n\nStrangers to Golarion, most coeurls harbor memories-either personal or those passed down through some inherited consciousness-of a racial homeland and a complex society long since lost to their people. Many coeurls actively seek to rediscover their lost home and might interrogate prey about what they know of magical portals or methods of interplanar travel before brutally harvesting their id. In some rare cases these deadly felines form temporary relationships with creatures capable of providing them with the transportation or sustenance they require, particularly powerful wizards, outsiders, or the mysterious denizens of Leng." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBlkJinni" name="Black Jinni" description="Thought by many, even among the jann, to be myths and dark legends, the black jinn are an accursed and forgotten tribe of genies. Bearers of ill will and bringers of destruction upon both mortals and their own kind, these hateful creatures are possessed by madness and a drive to call down ruin upon any who intrude upon their desolate sanctums. The few black jinn encountered on the Material Plane are thought of as terrors of the deep desert, arriving in sudden sandstorms, brilliant with electrical fury, and disappearing just as quickly to leave behind no trace of lost comrades, or merely leaving corpses, charred or glazed in molten glass. Largely, black jinn are creatures of myth and legend, but a handful of mortals know the terrible truth which few live long enough to tell.\n\nAlthough typically surrounded by a cloud of dust, black jinn appear more fiendish than other genies. A cursed creature, they do not constitute a true race of jann, but rather a bloodline so corrupt as to no longer be considered part of this proud race. A black jinni stands 12 feet tall and can weigh as much 1,200 pounds, its body being mostly comprised of soot, dust, and foul smoke.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe cursed remnant of some ancient bloodline of genies, black jinn are pariahs among even the other jinn races and have retreated over the years into the deepest, most desolate strongholds of the arid wastes of the Material Plane and the elemental planes. Also known by other names, such as black ghosts or nisnases, black jinn have no part in a natural ecology and tend to destroy any living things that exist in their vicinity. It is postulated that certain genies can become black jinn through utilizing taboo magic, trespassing upon sacred locations, or similarly provoking such misfortune, but such cases are largely undocumented and seem to be exceedingly rare.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nLegends of black jinn are often associated with fabled lost cities hidden for centuries under a sea of desert sands. These legends always speak of the great treasures harbored by such forgotten cities, as well as the certain death that their discovery entails. The legends are largely true, as black jinn seem to favor such locales, enduring ages-long hermitages or self-inflicted exiles in avoidance of other living beings, though they still enjoy the trappings of civilization-especially those in ruin. On occasion, though, a black jinni finds itself overcome by wanderlust for a time and seeks to investigate civilized lands. On these occasions, black jinn sometimes choose mortal targets to shadow and terrorize before finally closing in for the kill-often after engaging in a nocturnal battle of wits wherein the hapless mortal might have a slight chance of saving himself. Alternatively, a black jinni might settle near a community and slowly curse the inhabitants with its lingering presence until all the residents are dead or the jinni is driven off by some hired holy man." compset="Race">

Appearing much like monstrously huge parasites or insectile beings sculpted from the most unfit of living flesh, these things know only sleep and unrestrained hunger, proving endlessly ravenous for the lives of genie-kind. These revolting creatures&apos; armored bodies grow as long as 60 feet and weigh as much as 100,000 pounds. They have no known natural limit to their life spans unless they meet a violent end.\n \n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe get of Iblis spend most of their time in hibernation, slumbering for periods that can span thousands of years. Since their near-extinction at the hands of the genies, they seem to have lost their rampant natural instinct to compulsively hunt down and destroy the genie races, though if a genie is encountered, they seem to remember something of these impulses and relish in their destruction. However, the urge usually passes after the immediate genies are dealt with, and these spawn of Iblis are satisfied to return to their slumbers. Once every 20 years or so a get of Iblis awakes from its slumber and strikes out by night to seek prey, feasting and rampaging for a single evening before returning to sleep, seemingly lying in wait for their father&apos;s profane summons.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nNo one knows exactly to what corners of the multiverse the get of Iblis have fled, but they are rarely heard of and even more rarely encountered. When seen, the get of Iblis are typically solitary, and usually out on brief and surreptitious hunts after long hibernation before returning to sleep. On rare occasions, get of Iblis have been found and captured for use as arena beasts in the most malevolent of planar venues, or even as hunting hounds by powerful fiends with their own reasons for wishing to see genies and their ilk destroyed. Divs particularly delight in the discovery and ensnarement of Iblis&apos;s spawn, taking special pleasure in making use of these fearsome beasts, especially as no love is lost between these fiends and their jinn ancestors. The divs&apos; focus on the get of Iblis has led to some small interest in the creatures throughout the plane of Abaddon and among wider daemonkind. The beasts have even sparked the profane imagination of Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence, who regularly sends hunting parties of potent daemons to seek out these revolting menaces and drag them back to the bowels of the Plaguemere, where already at least a dozen lurk. Whether the Horseman merely delights in the terrifying and parasitic appearance of the beasts or if he has some greater plot involving the hungry, elemental horrors remains unclear.\n\n{b}Origins of the Begotten{/b}\nIn the earliest of ages, there was Iblis. Iblis was either god or monster, angel or demon, or perhaps a little of each. At one time, long before the advent of the mortal races, he commanded the fealty of much of genie-kind and ruled over them with a fist of iron. It is thought by some that it was perhaps in this time that the City of Brass was first constructed, as a monument to his might and power from whence he could rule over all the jinn. But in time the genies threw off his yoke of tyranny and became free to pursue their own natures and agendas. Vengeful Iblis did not relinquish his power quietly, and he searched far and wide for the means to bring about the destruction of all genies for what he perceived as the ultimate betrayal. To this end, he traveled to strange realms and trafficked with beings beyond imagination. Some of these he brought together in a harem of horrors, imprisoning terrifying and unnatural consorts to beget him vile children, embodiments of his barely restrained hatred, physical creatures as terrible as his wrath. Strongest of these get of Iblis were gigantic, worm-like creatures bred specifically to stalk and bring about the destruction of the genie races.\n\nWhen the get of Iblis first appeared and began to hunt Iblis&apos;s erstwhile servants, the genies found themselves unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with such natural-born predators of their kind. However, at a grand convention of all the genie races, chaired by the mighty padishah of the marids and held within the planar nexus of the City of Brass, an accord was reached between the ordinarily warring genie races that, for 1 week, all differences would be set aside to hunt down and destroy the cursed spawn of their old master. This is said to have been the first and last alliance between djinn and efreet, marids and shaitans, but it performed its task marvelously, creating a fierce and swift planeswide counter-hunt against Iblis&apos;s terrible spawn. Although the battles were costly and many genies fell, in the end the majority of the get of Iblis were wiped out across the sphere. Iblis disappeared into hiding-not to be seen in all the eons since-and his few surviving children retreated, finding hidden lairs at the darkest corners of the multiverse. Judging their work to be done, the alliance broke and the genie races went back to their own concerns, never to know accord again, secure in their knowledge that the vile get of Iblis no longer posed a threat to their existence.\n\nThe genies were largely right. The get of Iblis were devastated and the survivors scattered. However, occasionally one of these foul aberrations surfaces and invariably wreaks much havoc among the genie races before finally being put down again. The genies sleep secure in the knowledge of their victory, but some few take the time to ponder what fate may hold for them should errant and ever-hating Iblis ever rise from his mysterious refuge again." compset="Race">

Frequently identified as sea serpents by superstitious sailors, gandarevas possess four mighty arms, capable of plucking travelers from the decks of their ships and flinging them into stormy seas. Their mighty wings serve them almost as well above the waves as beneath, allowing them to sail over the waves nearly as swiftly as they swim below them. An adult gandareva measures almost 30 feet long and weighs upward of 15 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nWhile a threat to aquatic and seafaring races, gandarevas also threaten the very oceans in which they live. A gandareva left unchecked ruins local fishing by draining the sea dry of potential harvests. Seafaring nations whose economies rely on trade and fishing sometimes organize fleets of their most capable ships and sailors to hunt these vile creatures. Many such fleets never return.\n\nAlthough capable of living in the open air, gandarevas much prefer salt water, their scales becoming irritated and chafed if allowed to dehydrate. These azi willingly suffer such discomfort, though, if they believe they&apos;ve been stolen from or to repay a slight visited upon them by intruders or would-be thieves. Whole coastal communities have been laid to waste by the rampages of gandarevas who believe stolen bits of their treasure might have found their way to such places.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nGandarevas covet elaborate works of art, powerful magic items, and other riches that might garner them the jealously of kings and whose theft might spread war across whole nations. As much as they enjoy great wealth, they revel in being envied. They frequently spy on vessels crossing the seas for the presence of such treasures, endlessly seeking objects of fabulous value, such as the crown jewels of traveling royalty, the treasure ships of returning explorers, or even the storied weapons of great heroes. Once they possess such treasures, they do all they can to protect them, with one gandareva creating up to a dozen treasure vaults across its territory, using deadly aquatic guardians and magical wards to protect their stolen wealth. They never ally with sentient creatures, no matter how evil, being demonstrably paranoid about betrayal and potential theft.\n\nIncredibly territorial, gandarevas claim vast underwater territories around their lairs, holding dominion over their lands both above and below the waves. Knowing that living creatures are far more likely to bring new wealth into their lands than dead ones, they often demand tolls of ships passing through their waters. Some merchant conglomerates have even been known to pay yearly tithes to gandarevas to assure their ships remain safe-the most nefarious ones do this, then neglect to tell rivals of their shipping lanes&apos; native dangers." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruAziSruva" name="Azi, Sruvara" description="Though the smallest of the azi, sruvaras rival their brethren in potency. Their sleek build and stealthy manner allows them to stalk prey like the most deft jungle hunters, while their innate cunning and sadism make them blights upon whatever land they choose to despoil. While many azi are arrogant and greedy, sruvara are maniacal and cruel, reveling in the screams of long-tortured victims and the plight of parched villagers forced to choose between watering themselves or their children. One ancient legend told among desert claims the sruvara sprang from the lips of Ahriman himself as he uttered his first curse, a thing of living venom that would poison the world for all time.\n\nA sruvara&apos;s scales look like ridges of slate or flat gray metal. Between these scales, an organic olive-colored powder creeps like toxic verdigris. A typical adult sruvara measures 26 feet from the tip of its tapered snout to the toxic tip of its stinger, with most of this length accounted for by its long neck and tail. A sruvara stands 8 feet at the shoulder. Large yet thin, the average sruvara weighs only 2,200 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA sruvara&apos;s body acts like a massive, organic poisoner&apos;s laboratory. Bizarre organs and glands throughout the monster&apos;s body compound fluids to create some of the most deadly toxins found in the world, venoms that serve the dragons in both predation and defense. A sruvara eats a diverse diet, preferring other poisonous creatures, finding the toxins of other creatures rare spices in a vast menu of bland offerings-the more lethal, the more desirable. Sruvaras spend much of their time hunting giant vermin and serpents, although they&apos;ve also been known to stalk assassins-the more successful, the better-for both the taste of their poison and the satisfaction of bringing an end to a vain mortal&apos;s career. Wastewater, mine tailings, and even pockets of toxic gas can sustain a hungry sruvara, and the dragons often make their lairs among such fetid or polluted regions\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nKnown for their stealth and incredible toxicity, sruvaras are often called upon to act as assassins by more powerful azi and other extraordinarily powerful creatures, who bribe them with exotic delicacies or rare slaves to slowly slaughter. In addition to such payment, they sometimes barter for odd services and information, with reported trades including delivery of a pair of slain simurghs, political ruin for a local pasha, and a grant of exclusive hunting grounds. Once on the hunt, these venomous azi prove their skill as deadly hunters and ruiners. Although not as cunning as true dragons, sruvaras prepare elaborate traps to lure their victims to them, relishing the opportunity to distress their prey by kidnapping loved ones or forcing them to make impossible choices. They also care nothing for precision if such is not part of their agreement, and might poison an entire city just to kill or ferret out a single target.\n\nSruvaras tend to choose sinister or infamous lands to make their lairs, appreciating morbid surroundings and the privacy such environs lend them. Their climbing skills make forgotten canyons and deep pits in the earth just as viable dwellings as ruins devoured by marshlands or cliffs along foggy coasts.

  <thing id="ruAziZahha" name="Azi, Zahhak" description="Lords among the abominations of dragonkind, zahhaks rule as the most powerful race of azi dragons. First spawned by the corruptions wreaked by Ahriman, Lord of the Divs, and the foul dragon god Dahak, these bitter wyrms are named in honor of their draconic master and seek to sow fear and spread slaughter. Their very breaths are tainted with corruption, a vile double boon, half draconic flame, and half lethal poison, and from their claws seeps such depravity as to raise the dead from their graves. Enormous beasts, zahhaks resemble primeval wyrms with two black-scaled vipers lashing from each side of their necks. These smaller, serpentine heads are unthinking appendages, which lash out at any creature that comes too near. A zahhak measures upward of 35 feet from its muzzle to the base of its tail, and weighs over 18 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nZahhaks are among the most physically powerful of all azis, a fact they know well and flaunt over all creatures. While not the most intelligent of dragons, they are by no means dull-witted, yet many stories tell of a zahhak&apos;s greed or hunger luring it into a position of weakness or a cunning hero&apos;s trap. Although zahhaks possess wings, their powers of flight are terribly atrophied and they loathe the act, along with all creatures capable of soaring through the heavens. Their hatred is such that they have developed the might to speak a potent curse, striking from the skies and smashing to the earth any beast that hears their words.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nPrimarily found in the lands held by the Empire of Kelesh, east of the Inner Sea, zahhaks might also be found in many deserted lands throughout Golarion. Making their lairs among jagged hills, the ruins of ancient fortresses, and other such baleful or accursed lands, zahhaks adopt the roles of petty tyrants and dictators over the realms they claim as their own. With the power to enforce their wills upon most beings, they often command the service of divs, worshipers of Arhiman, or-begrudgingly-even other azi dragons. Whole villages might also pay homage to a zahhak, who demands ever greater and more gruesome tribute until finally it exhausts its lowliest slaves. Yet even death rarely releases victims from a zahak&apos;s clutches, as its blasphemous grip lingers on even after a creature&apos;s slaughter, resurrecting them as undead just as ravenous and greedy as their master and wholly devoted to his service.\n\nMany legends surround the might of zahhaks. The best known claim that these foul dragons can grant wonders to those who do evil in their name, yet such boons are cursed, and will not long bring the wicked recipient happiness. While few of these tales have ever been proven true, no terrible legend or dire warning could make one too fearful or cautious when encountering a zahhak." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruXotani" name="Xotani" description="A being of living flame and magma, crawled from the depths of Golarion and the prison of the caged god of destruction, Xotani the Firebleeder is one of the unfathomable monstrosities known and feared as the Spawn of Rovagug. A creature born of rage within the unfathomable depths of the world, it is a creature of pure devastation and hottest flames knowing only wrath, fire, and the harsh stone of the realms below. The surface world is pain to Xotani, especially the cursed sun, from which it retreats by day. By night, however, it bursts from the depths, preceded by sweeping firestorms and deadly claws and followed by a trail like a burnt pyre, all charred ruins and smoking corpses. It is rumored that vast tunnel systems melted into the earth by the passage of the Firebleeder spiderweb the lands of northeastern Garund-the region most devastated by Xotani&apos;s rampages-to modern times, immense subterranean corridors that still burn with the Spawn of Rovagug&apos;s passage.\n\nLike the majority of Rovagug&apos;s ruinous children, Xotani is wrath and devastation given life. It has no desires or intentions beyond destroying all that crosses its path and consuming the ashes. All the life, growth, and creations of the surface worlds are anathema to the living holocaust, which takes some measure of primal satisfaction in crushing the charred remains of such order, yet finds itself endlessly frustrated and incensed by the openness of the surface, the tepid storms and weak rages of weather, and the endless number of wet, hollowing things that fall in its wake. It makes no distinction between the servants of its terrible parent and all the other pathetic things of the lands above, burning and devouring all, caring nothing for whether its living tinder sees its flames as blessing or damnation.\n\nNumerous attempts were made to slay the Firebleeder before its rampage finally came to an end. Through innate cunning and unstoppable profane determination, the titanic abomination survived numerous and varied attempts to lay it low, including potent freezing magics, being magically dropped from an incredible height, and immersion in the Obari Ocean. Yet, despite its seemingly invincible form, Xotani was destroyed by an alliance of potent mages in 2104 ar, who, at the cost of untold lives, ended its rampage across northern Garund in the Brazen Peaks of western Katapesh. The remains of the Firebleeder&apos;s corpse lie in the volcanic caverns beneath the spire known as Pale Mountain-a peak said to take its color from the crushed bones of those who died battling the beast. Yet no terror as relentless as a Spawn of Rovagug ever truly dies, and there are those who would see the flames of Xotani rekindled to scour the dross of the world anew." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruAhriman" name="Ahriman" description="The evil of Ahriman is among the oldest and greatest known to geniekind. The tales of the jinn tell that with the first act of creation sprang to life the first genies, but also a shadow of inevitable destruction. From this shadow a spirit of annihilation was born, a primal embodiment of the doom that must inevitably come to all things to maintain the balance of existence. Through the countless millennia, this spirit came to be known as Ahriman, and ever has he confounded the works of genies and mortals.\n\nAhriman&apos;s ultimate goal and reason for existence is oblivion, for as much as he is a sentient being he is too a primal force of destruction. To aid him in his works throughout the multiverse, he corrupts the souls of destructive genies into subservient divs, along with twisting others against their kind in the creation of ghuls and other undead. In Abaddon his seed of destruction has found fertile soil in which to grow, where he rules over a bleak dominion from a mountaintop temple carved from the ruins of fallen monuments, where the sky swirls in a perpetual, apocalyptic void. From here he looks out upon the planes, painting ruin throughout them with the pigments of intricate curses, poorly worded wishes, and impossible quests. He delights in achistem manah or &#147;worst thinking,&#148; influencing of bad decisions and enticing sentient beings to turn away from wisdom. Through his efforts he hopes to turn all the efforts of reality toward destruction and hasten creation back to a peaceful, absolute oblivion.\n\nAhriman&apos;s presence is felt on Golarion not only through the actions of his div minions, but also in the machinations of the Usij. These heretical sorcerers and cultists revere Ahriman and spread a dogma of nihilism and atheism against all gods of creation. Though few Usij still practice on Golarion, they find ways to spread ruin throughout the lands, typically operating in places where life only tenuously holds out against destruction, such as desert regions like Kelesh, Qadira, and Katapesh. These vile spellcasters often seek to corrupt leaders with insidious council, all the while working to corrupt the land and despoil fundamental resources in the name of their foul lord. Usij have access to the domains of Darkness, Destruction, Death, and Evil.

Any creature within an area of magical silence is unaffected by the sonic damage or dominate monster effect of Ahriman&apos;s stomach. Swallowed creatures can escape through the use of plane shift or similar plane-traveling magic. The spells atonement, freedom, holy word, limited wish, miracle, or wish, or a channeling of positive energy made by a good-aligned cleric (Ahriman gets a Fort save with a DC equal to the amount of damage taken)-cast by either a creature outside or swallowed by Ahriman-stuns the Lord of the Divs for 1 round, forcing him to release every creature held within his stomach at once. If he has no creatures in his stomach, casting such spells has no effects. Summoning a creature with the good subtype or casting the spell holy aura within Ahriman also causes him to release every creature in his stomach." compset="RaceSpec" summary="Swallowed creatues are trapped in a damaging inescapable plane.">

  <thing id="deiuAhrima" name="Ahriman" description="{b}Lord of the Divs{/b}\nNE male demigod of divs, genies, oblivion and subversion\n\nThe evil of Ahriman is among the oldest and greatest known to geniekind. The tales of the jinn tell that with the first act of creation sprang to life the first genies, but also a shadow of inevitable destruction. From this shadow a spirit of annihilation was born, a primal embodiment of the doom that must inevitably come to all things to maintain the balance of existence. Through the countless millennia, this spirit came to be known as Ahriman, and ever has he confounded the works of genies and mortals.\n\nAhriman&apos;s ultimate goal and reason for existence is oblivion, for as much as he is a sentient being he is too a primal force of destruction. To aid him in his works throughout the multiverse, he corrupts the souls of destructive genies into subservient divs, along with twisting others against their kind in the creation of ghuls and other undead. In Abaddon his seed of destruction has found fertile soil in which to grow, where he rules over a bleak dominion from a mountaintop temple carved from the ruins of fallen monuments, where the sky swirls in a perpetual, apocalyptic void. From here he looks out upon the planes, painting ruin throughout them with the pigments of intricate curses, poorly worded wishes, and impossible quests. He delights in achistem manah or &#147;worst thinking,&#148; influencing of bad decisions and enticing sentient beings to turn away from wisdom. Through his efforts he hopes to turn all the efforts of reality toward destruction and hasten creation back to a peaceful, absolute oblivion.\n\nAhriman&apos;s presence is felt on Golarion not only through the actions of his div minions, but also in the machinations of the Usij. These heretical sorcerers and cultists revere Ahriman and spread a dogma of nihilism and atheism against all gods of creation. Though few Usij still practice on Golarion, they find ways to spread ruin throughout the lands, typically operating in places where life only tenuously holds out against destruction, such as desert regions like Kelesh, Qadira, and Katapesh. These vile spellcasters often seek to corrupt leaders with insidious council, all the while working to corrupt the land and despoil fundamental resources in the name of their foul lord. Usij have access to the domains of Darkness, Destruction, Death, and Evil. Ahriman&apos;s symbol is a black circle with a thin sliver of light overtaken by darkness." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruBuraq" name="Buraq" description="Buraqs are a race of good and noble creatures that sometimes serve as steeds to devout servants of the celestial realms. Related to lammasus, buraqs are also known for their great wisdom. Those seeking divine insight often climb high mountains to petition buraqs to impart their great knowledge, while pious warriors in search of a companion as pure in heart as themselves might endeavor to claim a buraq as a mount.\n\nA buraq has an equine body with a pure white coat, but instead of a horse&apos;s head and neck it has a human head with bronzed skin and thick black hair. Male buraqs have a man&apos;s face and favor full beards, while female buraqs have a woman&apos;s face and often wear silken veils. Buraqs of both sexes have the brightly colored tail and wings of a peacock, with a 20-foot wingspan. A typical adult buraq is the size of a mule or light horse, about 5 feet high at the shoulder and 8 feet long, and weighs between 1,000 and 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. The average lifespan of a buraq is about 200 years, although some particularly wise specimens have lived over 500 years.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nBuraqs are creatures of good, with a strong respect for dignity and life. They are dedicated to helping others, although they embrace freedom over authority. They keep their word, but give it carefully, and can become resentful of those who try to compel them. Buraqs have a kindly disposition, and are welcoming to those who approach them with honor and respect. They are willing to share their knowledge, and though they do not ask for compensation for their assistance, they gladly accept that which is freely given.\n\nBuraqs live high in the mountains, preferring warm desert climes, and make their homes on sheer cliff ledges or in secluded alpine meadows. They enjoy the freedom of the skies, and can be found soaring high in the clouds, reveling in the power and majesty of strong winds and thunderstorms. Buraqs prefer human food, but can subsist on horse fodder, if necessary. In times of hardship, they rely on their create food and water ability.\n \n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nBuraqs are solitary creatures, usually living alone in high mountain retreats. Buraqs mate for life, but a mated pair normally lives separately, only visiting each other once every year or two. The exception to this is when a couple has a child. Both parents raise the child together until it is old enough to care for itself at about 5 years of age. At that time, the entire family goes its separate ways. Occasionally, up to four buraqs will join together to form a &#147;wisdom,&#148; a conclave to share knowledge, discuss matters of import, or respond to a threat or great evil, but these are temporary gatherings at best, and dissolve when the business is finished.\n\nSome buraqs serve the celestial powers of good as mounts and allies, making regular journeys between the Material Plane and the Outer Sphere. These buraqs have coats of pure silver and golden hair, and often wear modest but colorful veils, bits of jewelry, or other ornaments. They gain the celestial template and the ability to plane shift once per day as a spell-like ability, and are believed to be so devout and pure that they have achieved immortality.\n\n{b}Burags as Mounts{/b}\nAlthough they can carry a rider, buraqs cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. This is usually a particularly devout and pure person of good alignment who the buraq feels is worthy of its companionship and protection. Often a petitioner must prove himself on some holy quest before the buraq consents to serve as a steed. A buraq is considered a special cohort, not a normal mount." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruEdimmu" name="Edimmu" description="Edimmus rise from the corpses of slain genies unable to return to their elemental homelands. Whether through powerful magics or as part of bargains made with mortal spellcasters, genies occasionally find themselves tied to the Material Plane for a specific term or until they complete a set task. As the conditions of some such magics remain binding even in death, genies that perish before the terms of their service are fulfilled sometimes manifest as creatures of uncontrolled fury. Even in their undead state, these genies still possess a measure of their mastery over the elements, using their powers to seek revenge upon those who led them to be trapped to their horrifying forms.\n\nEdimmus are ghostly, with ancient-looking, hunched skeletal frames that make them appear shorter than their average 6-foot heights.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe origins of the edimmu trace back to ancient times, when evil genies sought to entice mortals into worshiping them as gods. Fearful of such powerful beings with control of fate itself, human wizards developed ways to gain mastery over genies and force them to serve mortal whims. Some of the most hateful genies were punished for their cruelty, magically bound to the mortal world for all time, eternally denied the comforts and wonders of their native planes. When through murder or misfortune these genies perished, the early genie binders realized the potential danger within their magics as the angry souls of trapped genies rose from their corpses. Ever since, most who practice the magic of genie binding (see Pathfinder #21) have actively sought to avoid trapping the souls of their servants on the Material Plane, but still the enraged spirits of genies arise from ancient ruins or as the results of miscast magic.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nEdimmus are rare, even in those areas surrounding Katapesh, Osirion, and Qadira, where genies historically tread. While not fundamentally tied to specific locations, they infrequently wander, preferring to haunt locations that were meaningful to them in life-though the eldest souls rarely remember what significance such places once held for them. The homes of long-dead masters, favored places of long-despoiled luxury, or the sites of their death are the most common places for such souls to linger. Typically shunned and fraught with rumors of curses and dark magic, the lairs of edimmus often howl with unexplained winds and strange groans.\n\nAs victims of binding magics gone awry, many edimmus lie entrapped within forgotten prisons. More than one tale of fantastical discovery and ancient ruins ends with explorers disturbing some ancient magical symbol and unleashing the crazed spirit of a long-dead genie. As incorporeal creatures, it&apos;s wholly possible for someone to not realize that an edimmu lies imprisoned within an item or structure and accidentally set it free. Some good-natured explorers have sought to free edimmus from their captivity, but as the stipulations placed upon bound genies in ancient times often proved outlandish or obscure, few edimmus actually possess any lingering hope of freedom.\n\n{b}Treasure{/b}\nAs genies were often summoned in ancient times to serve as guardians, edimmus are typically found in the treasure vaults, harems, and audience chambers of their former masters. Although such places might have once harbored great wealth, few retain their splendor in modern times. Thus, only in the cases where an edimmu&apos;s lair has been lost or forgotten-often being reclaimed by the desert- do the riches of the past typically remain. Even in the cases where such fineries have faded, edimmus typically use their illusion abilities to recreate elaborate images recalling the wealth of times past. They often use such illusions to disguise traps and other dangers, so as to punish those who would attempt to steal from the spirits. In rare cases, though, an edimmu-or more likely a group of such creatures-has actually managed to defend the treasures of old and still guard vast troves of brass, gold, and jewels. Edimmus guard their treasures viciously, though, as such trinkets are all they have to remind them of the lives they&apos;ve long since lost.\n\n{b}Edimmu Wards{/b}\nKatapeshi and Qadiran folklore is filled with stories of pitiless edimmus who roam the earth seeking living creatures, spreading suffering and preying upon innocents. These tales often teach a moral lesson, usually revealed by a character who knows the spiritual wards that force a wicked edimmu to pass him by. Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Knowledge (local) check can recall these wards, which have the following effects:\n\n    Edimmus cannot pass over a circle of ox blood.\n    Edimmus will not harm a genie or other elemental creature.\n    Edimmus will not harm anyone who covers his or her body with funerary runes.\n    Edimmus will not harm anyone wearing a burial shroud or similar funerary garb.\n    Edimmus cannot stand the sound of a dirge and will flee anyone playing such somber music." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruSunThala" name="Sunlord Thalachos" description="Sunlord Thalachos is Sarenrae&apos;s favorite angel, liaison to the mortal world, the hosts of astral devas, and the ranks of superior angels (including the Empyreal Lords). At 8 feet tall and 300 pounds, he is an impressive figure with a rich baritone voice, always speaking with clarity and precision. His metallic skin is as hard as steel to any that wish to do him harm, but as soft as velvet to anyone kind, merciful, and good. He is the champion of the Dawnflower in Golarion and her favorite weapon against the spawn of Rovagug (though she only calls upon him for this when no mortal heroes are available). Before the death of Aroden he often delivered prophecies on behalf of the goddess, and several stories in The Birth of Light and Truth were penned by oracles whom he personally escorted through Sarenrae&apos;s realm. Now the only similar duty he bears is appearing at auspicious births. This is by no means the extent of his duties, though, as the goddess of the sun has tasked him with standing orders to guard her realm against fiendish-particularly infernal-incursions, keep watch for those who would free the imprisoned god Rovagug, and defend against those who would tamper with the sun itself.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThalachos does not need to eat or sleep, though he has been spotted drifting high in the sky on hot summer days, absorbing the sun&apos;s light. He can eat in the mortal fashion, but usually only does so when hospitality requires it, and limits himself to a small portion of bread and water or wine. In his true form he is a sexless masculine figure, and he is always described as Sarenrae&apos;s herald and advisor, never her consort. When he takes humanoid form he prefers that of a middle-aged Keleshite male, but even then he has no interest in the pleasures of the body, and there are no known lines of half-celestials or aasimars descended from him. The doves that accompany him are usually white but sometimes have golden feathers at their wingtips; in his humanoid form these doves usually appear as fireflies in a lantern, though sometimes they remain nearby in bird form. The doves never attack, and while Thalachos is alive they instantly recover from any injury.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThe angel is a dangerous force in battle, but prefers activities relating to the more peaceful aspects of Sarenrae&apos;s faith. In times of peace he wanders the world disguised as a humble priest of the Dawnflower, using his spell-like abilities to cure sickness and injuries. He dislikes lies and riddles, but enjoys long, truthful stories, especially if they illustrate a moral point. In communities struggling to harvest enough food, he uses daylight and continual flame to illuminate their fields and granaries to give them extra time. When confronting evildoers he likes to stun them, tie them up, and drag them to town for an appropriate punishment-and a chance to atone for their sins.\n\nSome chapters of Sarenrae&apos;s faith claim that Thalachos is reborn every day. Certainly he has died in battle and appeared unharmed at a later time, though there is insufficient evidence to answer whether he actually rises again at the dawn. Some sects call him Saint Thalachos and explain that he was the first human priest of Sarenrae, though again there is no historical evidence for this and the angel has never said he was ever anything other than an angel. He is on friendly terms with the heralds of Shelyn, Cayden Cailean, and Iomedae, and several sources show that he knew Arazni, herald-goddess of Aroden." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

They are highly territorial as well as voracious predators, which one might infer by their thick, arrowhead-shaped teeth.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe unchosen live short lives, and die approximately a decade after undergoing the crude surgery that births them. Unchosen born naturally to unchosen parents could, theoretically, live for 30 years or more, but in reality they often die much sooner, either from violence or deformity. Throughout an unchosen&apos;s life, its body continues its horrid devolution, slowly twisting and mutating until these deformities become crippling and ultimately result in death.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAlthough the unchosen have, to date, only appeared among the Carrion Tribe gnolls of the House of the Beast, these hulking gnoll mutants are poised to become a new and terrible menace in the Pale Mountain region and beyond. Although the first unchosen were artificially induced from the bodies and minds of gnoll sacrifices (sometimes willing, sometimes not so much), the unchosen breed true, and even now two small tribes of the ogrish gnolls escaped from the House of the Beast have settled into small tribes in isolated caves on Pale Mountain&apos;s lower slopes.\n \n{b}Creation{/b}\nThe process of unchosen creation is based on the sacred and dangerous Lamashtan ritual known as the Growing of the Third Eye. A worshiper of Lamashtu uses this ritual to drill or cut a hole into a creature&apos;s brow, just between his eyes. The trepanation is said to grant a third eye, just like that possessed by the Mother of Monsters, and indeed when done properly with the appropriate rituals, gnolls who undergo the painful ritual seem to gain strange insights.\n\nThe first unchosen was created from a gnoll named Ghartok after he was infused by raw unholy power from a stegocentipede sacred to the faith of Rovagug. Impressed with his newfound power, Ghartok (now the Carrion King) captured a mad alchemist, whom he forced to discover a method of duplicating this transformation. By combining the Growing of the Third Eye and a number of vile alchemical concoctions, the alchemist managed to duplicate most of the unchosen transformation, but the process invariably results in the destruction of the gnoll&apos;s mind. They emerge as strong and powerful as intended, but are little more than difficult-to-control beasts, nearly as dangerous to their allies as they are to their enemies. Of course, the results of the transformation embody the teachings of the Rough Beast, for he is a god of wrath and destruction, and as long as prayers to Rovagug remain a part of the transformation process, it is unlikely that any alchemist will be able to create an unchosen that retains its reason and intelligence.\n\nThe actual process is grisly and painful, and takes 2d4 hours to properly perform. At the end of this procedure, the gnoll must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Success indicates that the procedure merely causes 2d6 points of damage and 1d12 points of Intelligence drain-if this drain reduces the gnoll&apos;s Intelligence to 0, he is killed by the procedure. If the gnoll fails the saving throw, he undergoes a 24-hour transformation into one of the hulking unchosen-during this period of change, the gnoll lies in a fevered state and is effectively helpless, but when he wakens, his transformation is complete.\n\n{b}The Chosen{/b}\nAlthough the process that creates them encourages unchosen that are nearly mindless and feral, no procedure is perfect. It hasn&apos;t happened yet in the House of the Beast, but there&apos;s a 1% chance that a newly created unchosen retains its mind and reason. These unchosen would be even more dangerous than their kin, as they would combine their physical strength with intelligence and the will to be more than merely a monster. A chosen gnoll has all the stats of an unchosen, save that its Intelligence score rises to 12, granting it additional skill points. A chosen gnoll&apos;s class skills are Acrobatics, Climb, Perception, and Survival." compset="Race">

The trepanation is said to grant a third eye, just like that possessed by the Mother of Monsters, and indeed when done properly with the appropriate rituals, gnolls who undergo the painful ritual seem to gain strange insights.\n\nThe first unchosen was created from a gnoll named Ghartok after he was infused by raw unholy power from a stegocentipede sacred to the faith of Rovagug. Impressed with his newfound power, Ghartok (now the Carrion King) captured a mad alchemist, whom he forced to discover a method of duplicating this transformation. By combining the Growing of the Third Eye and a number of vile alchemical concoctions, the alchemist managed to duplicate most of the unchosen transformation, but the process invariably results in the destruction of the gnoll&apos;s mind. They emerge as strong and powerful as intended, but are little more than difficult-to-control beasts, nearly as dangerous to their allies as they are to their enemies. Of course, the results of the transformation embody the teachings of the Rough Beast, for he is a god of wrath and destruction, and as long as prayers to Rovagug remain a part of the transformation process, it is unlikely that any alchemist will be able to create an unchosen that retains its reason and intelligence.\n\nThe actual process is grisly and painful, and takes 2d4 hours to properly perform. At the end of this procedure, the gnoll must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Success indicates that the procedure merely causes 2d6 points of damage and 1d12 points of Intelligence drain-if this drain reduces the gnoll&apos;s Intelligence to 0, he is killed by the procedure. If the gnoll fails the saving throw, he undergoes a 24-hour transformation into one of the hulking unchosen-during this period of change, the gnoll lies in a fevered state and is effectively helpless, but when he wakens, his transformation is complete.\n\n{b}The Chosen{/b}\nAlthough the process that creates them encourages unchosen that are nearly mindless and feral, no procedure is perfect. It hasn&apos;t happened yet in the House of the Beast, but there&apos;s a 1% chance that a newly created unchosen retains its mind and reason. These unchosen would be even more dangerous than their kin, as they would combine their physical strength with intelligence and the will to be more than merely a monster. A chosen gnoll has all the stats of an unchosen, save that its Intelligence score rises to 12, granting it additional skill points. A chosen gnoll&apos;s class skills are Acrobatics, Climb, Perception, and Survival." compset="Race">
