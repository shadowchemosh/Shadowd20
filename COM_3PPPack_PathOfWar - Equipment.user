  <thing id="ioPWTrvlog" name="Travelogue" description="This small, leather-bound book is about the size of a personal journal or notebook and can be easily carried in one hand. Though it is possible to use the Travelogue as a normal notebook (and it never seems to run out of pages, though it cannot be used to scribe spells or scrolls), in the hands of a Walker of the Wayward Path it gains magical qualities. Anything written in the travelogue is also recorded in the Grand Library, where the information is stored both as an ongoing narrative collected as a story of that Walker’s life and separated out and sorted into its various topics for research purposes. Additionally, once per day, the Walker may concentrate on the book as a swift action and gain the ability to hear and be heard by every other Walker using this function of the travelogue for 1 hour, regardless of distance or planar boundaries. This may not be broken down into smaller increments. At the DM’s discretion, this may offer a circumstance bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks if the Walker can ask an expert for advice via the travelogue. Finally, the travelogue acts as an activation key to all portals that lead to the Grand Library, regardless of their normal activation keys. A Walker of the Wayward Path who violates her oath (see above) loses the benefits of the Endurance feat, as well as access to the additional functions of their travelogue beyond its limitless pages, until they atone by traveling to the Great Library and recording the details of their deception, as well as a formal apology. Repeat offenses are usually met with the deceptive ‘member’ being barred from the Grand Library and, possibly, killed by some of the less forgiving Walkers.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b} The travelogue may be destroyed by writing a blatant falsehood in it, then shelving it in the Grand Library amongst the rest of the collection. The book comes unbound, then shrivels into dust before blowing away on a phantom wind." compset="Wondrous">
