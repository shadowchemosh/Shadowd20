  <thing id="ruNingyo" name="Ningyo" description="The bane of fishermen and divers, ningyos lurk in tropical waters, gorging themselves on fish and attacking anything they can sink their tiny fangs into. Nasty little things, these primitive, miniature mer-monsters are bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out of both blind ravenousness and blunt stupidity. With little more organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling teeth.\n\nYet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for their unquiet deaths.

  <thing id="ruDimorph" name="Dimorphodon" description="Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves. The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the water in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won&apos;t hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger.\n\nThe dimorphodon is a robust pterosaur with a distinctively large skull-yet numerous hollows in the skull keep the creature&apos;s weight rather low and allow it greater agility. The dimorphodon&apos;s jaws contain two separate rows of differently shaped teeth: several larger fangs near the front (which are used to grip prey and inject poison) and a much larger number of smaller, sharp teeth along the rest of the jaw (used to cut through flesh). This unusual combination of different teeth is why in some areas the dimorphodon is known as the &#147;fangbird&#148; or the &#147;vampire lizard,&#148; although they don&apos;t actually drink blood. Dimorphodons normally feed on fish, small reptiles, and birds, but when particularly hungry, flocks of these creatures have been known to gang up on larger prey, swooping in to bite and then retreating to watch from nearby cliff ledges or tree branches while the victim slowly succumbs to the poison. Once the creature is rendered helpless, the flock descends to eat its victim alive. Dimorphodons are particularly easy to train, and they&apos;re often used as guardians by local tribes or kept as exotic pets in larger cities. A Handle Animal check to train a dimorphodon is made with a +4 bonus, and a dimorphodon can know one bonus trick of its trainer&apos;s choice once it is fully domesticated." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruTuyewera" name="Tuyewera" description="The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy&apos;s lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead-in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse&apos;s tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their tongues to repeat the process.\n\n{b}Variant Tuyeweras{/b}\nThe statistics presented above are for a typical tuyewera created from the body of a Medium humanoid creature, but there are methods by which tuyeweras can be created from the bodies of smaller or larger humanoids as well. While in theory, one should be able to create a tuyewera from a non-humanoid creature, so far necromancers have been unable to achieve this feat. Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used simply doesn&apos;t translate to non-humanoid bodies-although the unique undead created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly tuyeweras. Guidelines for statting up smaller and larger tuyeweras appear below.\n\n{i}Smaller Tuyeweras:{/i} Tuyeweras created from the bodies of gnomes, halflings, or even children of larger humanoids can be statted up by applying the young creature simple template.\n\n{i}Larger Tuyeweras:{/i} A tuyewera created from the body of a giant can be Large or larger. You can simply apply the giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its stats-whenever a tuyewera&apos;s Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it increases its Charisma score. A Large tuyewera has 10 HD and is CR 6. A Huge one has 14 HD and is CR 8. A Gargantuan one has 18 HD and is CR 11. The largest, Colossal tuyeweras, have 22 HD and are CR 14.\n\n{b}Creating a Tuyeweras{/b}\nA tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse&apos;s tongue and severing its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster to anoint the tuyewera&apos;s severed limbs and tongue with special medicines. These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and tongue (if it does, it immediately attacks its creator). When the spell is complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera&apos;s burnt limbs and tongue on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes them and seeks out its creator unerringly (as if via locate creature, but with no range limitation) and attempts to kill him-referably as the creator sleeps." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBiloko" name="Biloko" description="Blood-red man-eaters and cunning jungle stalkers, biloko hunt those who think themselves hunters, preying upon foolish travelers and incautious jungle natives with maniacal zeal. Lanky and quick humanoids, biloko possess exaggerated, fearfully expressive facial features, including mouths capable of stretching impossibly wide. Adept at blending in amid jungle underbrush despite their brilliant coloration, these ferocious jungle fey delight in constructing deadly traps, tricking victims into deadly ambushes, and leading enthralled foes into dangerous situations.\n\nThe average biloko stands between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 50 pounds, though a biloko who has recently fed might bear the weight of a far greater creature.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nWild-eyed and unpredictable, biloko are feared by many natives of the jungle and the tropical lands around their verdant hunting grounds. Frequent menaces in both the fireside tales of children and the bravest adults&apos; nightmares, they embody the most common fears of the jungle, proving that beneath the jungle canopy lurk forces that seek to do the unwary harm and can make even experienced warriors disappear without a trace.\n\nBiloko exclusively consume humanoid meat, and though they tend to prowl near forest-side villages, prey can be sparse at times. A biloko can live without sustenance for a lengthy period, but the hunger it eventually suffers proves nearly maddening. Sometimes fasting for weeks at a time, the intense hunger pains a biloko feels may drive it to cannibalism, though such occurrences are somewhat rare.\n\nA biloko&apos;s mouth stretches across its face in a grotesque, unnatural fashion, and it can consume a whole humansized creature in one terrible, hours-long bite, dislocating its jaw like a snake in order to do so. With the aid of its acidic saliva, its powerful maw is capable of grinding flesh and bone into a concentrated, compact form, allowing it to digest and survive off of a single meal for the extended period of time it may be forced to fast while awaiting new prey. If uninterrupted, an eager, starving biloko can swallow an adult human in about 3 hours.\n\nBiloko are related to the jungle spriggans known as Eloko, though they are far less organized and more at home in the jungle depths. While wilder and more bloodthirsty than their spriggan kin, biloko possess several similar physical traits, though their gaunt builds and bright red skins make the two unmistakably distinct. Some biloko look on their fey kin as strangely colored relatives, while other biloko attack them just as they would any other stranger. Thus, little special connection exists between the two races.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nBiloko are cruel, mischievous humanoids, known and feared by all who dare live near a forest plagued with the vile beings. Non-locals are urged never to travel alone; those foolish enough to ignore these warnings are seldom seen again. Whether hunting for food or journeying through the wilderness, locals know well to move in groups.\n\nWhile biloko are intelligent beings, their reclusive habits and lust for flesh drive them from any sort of civilized society. They keep mostly to deep, dark areas of the forest, and are rarely seen on the woods&apos; outskirts. Their numbers are small enough that it is rare for two unacquainted biloko to run into each other on a given day, but the species is sufficiently widespread to pose a threat to all travelers.\n\nBiloko are not social creatures by nature, but recognize the benefit of traveling in a group. When stealth is not of primary concern, several biloko might band together in order to hunt. While not organized by a tribal system, biloko often identify other biloko long residing in a region as friendly, although they remain cautious when encountering newcomers. They rarely see others of their kind as enemies, but more typically as rivals who begrudgingly allow one another to hunt on the same turf.\n\nBiloko rarely deal with other sentient beings-save during a meal. They choose lives of isolation from other races, usually dwelling within dark forests where their fiendish acts are less likely to be noticed by strangers. Large, hollow trees provide shelter for the small humanoids, who drape cloths of moss and ivy across the gaping portals behind which they slumber. A biloko often waits stealthily in his hideout, perched in one position for most of the day as he hungrily anticipates an unwary group of travelers or a lone wanderer. Once such a party or individual has passed, the monster creeps out of his hole, giving his prey a wide berth as he stalks it. At a time he deems appropriate-usually when a traveler is alone or has strayed from the group-the biloko whistles, creating an enchanting melody that draws his target near. The encounter ultimately ends in either the victim&apos;s hideous consumption or the biloko&apos;s flight.\n\nFar from being anchored to his hiding spot, a biloko often leaves his nook to wander the forest in search of other hiding spots on the edges of trails or well-trodden paths. Boring through a stump or the trunk of a tree with his razor-sharp claws, he can create a new abode in the span of several hours. A single biloko can have as many as a dozen hollow tree-holes, which provide valuable landmarks in the often complex jungle-maze he inhabits, as well as safety from pursuing predators or attackers.\n\nDuring his exploratory treks through the thick brush, a biloko might acquire dozens of fruits and berries for their bright colors, carrying the goods back to his nearest hiding hole to gaze upon later. Biloko have little interest in metals and artifacts, though they occasionally stumble upon a particular object they find especially attractive or interesting. They do, however, love gems, as the brightly colored crystals appear dazzling in the creatures&apos; enhanced vision. This sense of sight, which makes anything not green in color stand out magnificently, helps biloko spot prey even in the thickest of jungles, where the skyscraping canopy blots out the sun for miles." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruMosqSwBd" name="Mosquito Swarm, Bloodhaze" description="Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes&apos; relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.\n\nA typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child&apos;s fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the swarm&apos;s presence.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nBloodhaze mosquitoes always sate themselves on the blood of other animals, using their darkvision and ability to detect pheromones to track prey. They typically lie in wait near water sources where they can both breed and feed on animals that come to drink. Warm-blooded creatures draw their attention more quickly than amphibians or reptiles, though even lizards, snakes, and frogs become food sources during leaner times.\n\nNot only does blood provide sustenance to bloodhaze mosquitoes, but the females actually require it to reach egg-laying maturity. Females must also have water in which to lay their eggs, though even a sewage-filled mud puddle will suffice. A single female mosquito can lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch into larvae after 2 days. Many of these eggs suffer the predation of fish and other aquatic scavengers during this time of vulnerability. The surviving eggs hatch, releasing larvae that molt and shed their skins while feeding on organic matter and microorganisms in the water. Then they enter a pupal stage, conserving energy as they undergo a final transformation before finally emerging as fully grown adults. The entire hatching and growth process takes less than a single week.\n\nAfter reaching maturity, bloodhaze mosquitoes swiftly take to the air, naturally drawn to one another through their pheromones and banding together in swarms strong enough to challenge any animal for territorial supremacy. The life of a typical bloodhaze mosquito spans only 3 months. They spend that time ravenously feeding in their swarms, consuming enough blood that their females can continue laying eggs. The mosquitoes possess no maternal or protective instincts, however, quickly abandoning their progeny before dying out to be replaced by them.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nBloodhaze mosquitoes live in tropical wetlands, only venturing farther away when hunting becomes scarce or high winds carry them into other regions. Unintelligent predators, the mosquitoes give off pheromones to maintain their swarm&apos;s cohesion. Specific scent markers for distress, mating, and food rule most of their behavior. Powerful, false odors or thick and pungent smoke can sometimes mask or disrupt this communication, as can immersion in water, leading to traditions among many native peoples of coating themselves in sulphurous mud or burning reeking torches during the height of the mosquitoes&apos; feeding seasons.\n\nAlthough bloodhaze mosquitoes don&apos;t feed on other insects, they do prove highly territorial. While swarming, a group of the mosquitoes will attack and kill any other insects they encounter. Such ferocity can wipe out whole hives or nests of insectile jungle inhabitants, potentially having farther-reaching ramifications for other creatures speedy or canny enough to escape the swarms. In more dramatic instances, swarms might fell massive jungle insects or the populations of whole areas, leaving trails of crunching insectile corpses to mark their path." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruChemosit" name="Chemosit" description="From the time their children are young, Mwangi tribesfolk tell them chilling tales of the savage, childeating chemosit. While most believe these stories hold little truth and serve only to keep children from wandering too far from their villages, others know better. Few who have witnessed the gruesome work of the chemosit survive. Bearing terrible scars, both physical and mental, they recall the creature&apos;s utter savagery and inhuman strength. Tribes living in close proximity to chemosits believe them to be the living embodiment of wrathful gods or nature spirits, and pay them grisly sacrifices. In such places, those who suffer the beast&apos;s attacks are often blamed for the violence and exiled. In other regions, evil shamans capable of summoning or commanding these beasts gain great power and infamy. It is a common practice for warring tribes to pay such shamans to summon a chemosit to plague the villages of their enemies.\n\nChemosits stand over 9 feet tall on average and weigh upward of 750 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nChemosits (or Mwangi ape-bears, as northerners sometimes refer to the creatures) are readily identified by their thick and bristly dark-blue fur and broad, stumpy tails. Beneath their fur, coils of muscle stretch across their broad frames, and they move with ferocious confidence. Chemosits can walk upright or run on all fours, and are able climbers. A chemosit&apos;s face is a mix of simian and ursine features, with a long lower jaw and the sharp, powerful teeth of a dedicated carnivore. Perhaps its most identifiable characteristic, however, is its terrifying roar. On still nights, its grim echoes roll through the forests, leaving all who hear it sleepless with fright.\n\nStrict carnivores, chemosits go through monthly feeding cycles. During the first cycle, they barely eat, often passing the entire month without feeding. During the second cycle, they emerge as voracious predators. Chemosits hunt nocturnally, preferably on dark moonless nights. Able climbers, they often hide in trees, dropping down upon prey from great heights. They favor easy prey, such as cattle, but they consider humans a delicacy and do not hesitate to attack and devour lone travelers or small groups, their favorite morsel being the brain. Feasting upon brains invigorates chemosits, though in varying ways depending on the type of creatures they consume. Some even say that chemosits take on the knowledge and powers of creatures whose brains they ingest, a legend supported by the strange powers or behaviors exhibited by individuals that have recently gorged. Chemosits often stalk villages, entering each night by stealth and stealing away with sleeping victims, preferably children, the infirm, or others too weak to defend themselves.\n\nA small number of bold or reckless exotic animal trainers value chemosits for their hunting and tracking abilities. They pay top coin for newborns or cubs, and attempt to raise them in captivity, training them to track down and ferret out prey. A competent handler can typically train them to follow simple commands, particularly instinctive concepts like &#147;hunt&#148; and &#147;kill.&#148; Most captive-bred chemosits are accomplished trackers. Once they taste fresh blood, however, they eventually turn feral; thus trainers typically attempt to get to targets before their pets.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nChemosits live in Mwangi&apos;s most remote and fiercest jungles, where they can find massive boab trees capable of supporting their tremendous weight. They choose regions with large trees near fresh water supplies and, if possible, caves. For the untrained, chemosits&apos; territory is difficult to detect. They leave behind few traces of their passing, fastidiously scratching out their tracks and burying their dung. Principally arboreal, chemosits spend the majority of their waking time climbing through the shadowy understory. Caves serve chemosits not as shelters, but as repositories for the remains of their kills. It is unknown why chemosits create such middens, though some suggest they use the scent of carrion to attract prey.\n\nChiefly nocturnal, chemosits retire to the safety and shadows of high trees by day. Once darkness falls, the creature hunts with reckless voraciousness.\n\nChemosits live in small patriarchal clans dominated by an alpha male. Male chemosits are solitary hunters, and establish their clan status through their kills. As they seek out larger game, particularly creatures not found in the deep forest, their hunting grounds often grow to extend beyond the borders of their clan territory. Clan members that display the largest and most impressive kills rise in status and gain access to preferred hunting grounds and mates." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruPersFury" name="Personification of Fury" description="Gozreh&apos;s herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air and water. It may in fact have once been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dualmaterial elemental shape.\n\nUnusual in that it is one of the few elemental creatures serving the Wind and the Waves, Personification of Fury is often courted by the elemental lords to join their ranks as a high-ranking general or advisor on the mortal world, but Fury dislikes the lords&apos; squabbling and petty wars among their kind, seeing itself as a perfect example of how in the material realm elements should mix together without jealousy. It remains neutral in the dealings of various planar entities, and with Gozreh&apos;s permission it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival forces-but only in a direct, blunt, and expedient way, for it is a creature of force and action, not gentle diplomacy. Its actions have attracted a small number of sycophants and refugees from the elemental wars, air and water elementals tired of battle and looking for other ways to fill their immortal lives; these creatures follow Fury and allow it to summon them, and in faithful service to it they allow mortals to summon them. When the herald is on the Material Plane and left idle (such as before a battle or while guarding a sacred place), it entertains itself by summoning dozens of Small elemental minions and sending them scurrying about, letting them explore for a few minutes and get into mischief.\n\nThough Gozreh is both male and female, alternates genders frequently, and answers to both male and female pronouns, Personification of Fury is genderless, and is easily offended if someone calls it a &#147;he&#148; or &#147;she.&#148; It also dislikes being called &#147;the&#148; Personification of Fury, as if its name were a title; if a speaker doesn&apos;t want to use its full name, it expects to be called &#147;Fury.&#148; It has a short temper, and has been known to blast even servants of Gozreh with cold or lightning if sufficiently annoyed (though more as a warning than with intent to kill)-those who anger it receive no mercy just because they share the same deific master. It prefers to be conjured during active storms or when such phenomena are nearby; a caster who calls the herald under these circumstances (whether natural or invoked by magic such as control weather) gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to bargain with it. The creature is also fond of certain monoliths and standing stones used by the church of Gozreh, some of which include large stone faces or roughly anthropomorphic figures. It often flows into such idols, giving them life and speaking as though it were the voice of Gozreh. Having a penchant for dramatics, it might use its control over an object and varied abilities to pose as the deity on a whim or to guide mortals on a desired course.\n\nAs a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives-even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nPersonification of Fury is an elemental outsider, and does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. However, it enjoys mixing with the thin air on mountaintops, skimming misty valleys, or tasting the icy waters of the deep ocean. It sometimes forgets its own strength, and may accidentally crush, freeze, or electrocute nearby creatures and objects- its errant bolts of lightning have started many forest fires. It is amoral in this destruction, just as it is in any help it unintentionally provides. Certain magical pools, springs, and streams in the mortal realm may be inadvertent manifestations of its presence, changing the ecology of the region where they appear for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFury has no urge to reproduce or create more of its kind; interacting with its minions and mortal worshipers of Gozreh is the closest it comes to familial interests. On the rare occasions when one of its elementals is permanently slain, it has been known to grieve for years, becoming more withdrawn and prone to outbursts, though its attitude is more that of a creature who has lost a pet than that of someone who has lost a friend or relative. When it finishes grieving, it usually travels to the Plane of Air or Plane of Water, working with the lords there in hopes of finding another like-minded minor elemental minion who may replace the one who was lost. Because the herald can recover from almost any injury as long as a small portion of it remains, some elementals wandering the Material Plane may actually be derived from its substance, cleaved off in some mighty battle and only becoming self-aware after gathering sufficient air or water-though they would not recognize any kinship." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruCamulatz" name="Camulatz" description="Hidden within the high canopy overlooking the jungle floor dwells a race of enormous, vicious, and vibrantly colored birds known as camulatz. Possessing a cruel intelligence, camulatz are vile headhunters and aggressive demon-worshipers, preying on all sentient creatures as sacrifices to their chosen demon lord: Pazuzu, King of the Wind Demons. Camulatz revel in trickery and bloodshed, luring victims into ambushes where the camulatz can indulge their bloodlust and take their victims&apos; heads as grisly trophies.\n\nThe iridescent coloration of a camulatz&apos;s feathers assists in mesmerizing unfortunate souls, luring them to the killing ground below the brightly colored bird&apos;s aerie. Camulatz also have a special affinity for sounds, naturally mimicking voices and animal noises, while perfecting the magical ability to displace such sounds, making them seem to emanate from other creatures or objects. Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above.\n\nAll camulatz possess sharp talons on their feet, capable of rending the most heavily armored foes, but they rely on their cruelly curved beaks to decapitate their victims. The vivid patterns of a camulatz&apos;s feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can deflect ranged attacks.\n\nA mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure. Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCamulatz are carnivores who prefer the raw flesh of intelligent creatures above all else, but they also hunt large jungle mammals, reptiles, and even fish to augment their diet or when their favored prey is particularly scarce. The ferocious birds especially enjoy eating the heads of their victims, whom they decapitate with their razorsharp beaks, preferably while the victim is still alive. Camulatz devour the bodies of their victims without ceremony, but they take the severed heads back to their treetop aeries for ritual feasts, dining on the eyes, ears, tongues, and brains as savored delicacies. Thereafter, camulatz save their victims&apos; skulls as trophies, using them as tribute to Pazuzu, ornamentation for their nests, and markers for the bounds of their territory and favored hunting grounds.\n\nWhile camulatz never forget which individual is responsible for harvesting a given skull, most groups prefer to store their skulls communally, as they believe that their demonic patron finds more appeal in a single titanic collection of skulls than many small individual ones. As such, each aerie has a central altar where skulls are stacked in order of ascending prominence. This location, known as the Place of Screeching, is often used as a meeting place or the location for important rituals, and powerful females may occasionally choose to mate directly upon the altar in the hope that Pazuzu will notice and, in his demonic voyeurism, provide the resulting offspring with fiendish boons. For both genders, however, providing the skull that crowns the altar&apos;s tower is a lifelong goal for every individual.\n\nCamulatz mate only once a year, or even less, usually with different partners on each occasion. During mating cycles, female camulatz use their hypnotic display ability to lure and seduce their chosen mates, mating frantically and violently with the entranced, nearly helpless males. Afterward, females lay 1-3 eggs, which they jealously guard thereafter-even driving away the fathers-until the eggs hatch in about 3 months. Females communally raise their young for 2 years until the hatchlings reach adulthood, at which point the fully grown camulatz separate according to gender-the males band together to hunt and raid, while the females establish new aeries to maintain and defend. Camulatz have lifespans of 80 to 100 years, and though they have no written histories or oral legends beyond the braggadocio of individual members, their memories are long, and a camulatz never forgets a slight or the face of a prey animal that got away.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCamulatz make their homes in treetop aeries high above the jungle floor, only venturing below their canopy homes when hunting. Male camulatz range the farthest afield, often spending days or even weeks away from home, building temporary nests on the borders of their territory from which to launch hunting sorties. Meanwhile, female camulatz rule over the larger aeries, safeguarding their eggs and hatchlings. Both genders are equally violent and capable in combat.\n\nCamulatz believe they are the chosen followers of Pazuzu, revering the demon prince in all they do. They view the act of decapitation as a holy sacrifice to Pazuzu, and their faith requires them to appease their demon lord by sacrificing a sentient creature at least once per month. Camulatz believe that consuming a creature&apos;s head gives them some measure of the victim&apos;s power-hence the reason for preying on intelligent creatures rather than simple beasts-and that these ritual feedings attract the favor of their demon lord.\n\nCamulatz bear a special hatred for monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Lamashtu, taking up the same battle waged between Pazuzu and the Mother of Monsters. As such, the skulls of gnolls, monkey goblins, and jungle harpies are especially prized by camulatz, and frequently decorate their lairs. Some Mwangi tribes even appease camulatz by offering them such captives in exchange for safe travel through the camulatz&apos;s territory or safety from predation, though any deals made with the notoriously fickle bird people are tenuous at best. Many are the tribes who thought to purchase their safety with slaves and sacrifices, only to find their members&apos; own skulls mounted among the sacrifices in the camulatz&apos;s Place of Screeching." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruMokMbmb" name="Mokele-Mbembe" description="Known as &#147;water lions&#148; in some local tongues, mokelembembe are large, reptilian predators that inhabit the hottest jungles, always close to lakes, rivers, or other large bodies of water. A mokele-mbembe&apos;s long, whiplike tail accounts for half its length. Its dense, fourlegged body is the size and shape of an elephant&apos;s, and its greenish-brown hide has the texture of tree bark. An adult mokele-mbembe can grow up to 40 feet in length and weighs almost 10 tons. Males are only slightly longer and heavier than females.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough they resemble some larger, herbivorous dinosaurs, mokele-mbembe are cunning and territorial predators. They make their lairs in riverside caves, close to their food source, where they can sun themselves after eating. Natural swimmers, mokele-mbembe have webbed feet, but their long legs enable them to move easily on land as well. They spend much of their time in the water, where they can relax and float or use their long necks to attack while submerged, favoring blind river bends to ambush prey. Mokele-mbembe require large quantities of food daily, and feed on fish, birds, and even large mammals-humanoids included. Hippopotamuses are a favorite prey, and mokele-mbembe attack them on sight. Battles between these two river giants are legendary among local tribes, whose shamans often see portents or prophecies in the outcomes.\n\nA mokele-mbembe&apos;s powerful jaws contain sharp teeth for tearing chunks of meat from prey. The barklike texture of the creature&apos;s hide is actually caused by a network of osteoderms that provide added protection against competing predators and larger herbivores. Thanks to a pair of parallel, beam-like bones at the top of its rear legs, the mokele-mbembe carries a massive tail that tapers from a wide base to an end no wider than a halfling&apos;s finger. A vast array of muscles and flexible vertebrae within the tail let the creature move this appendage with surprising speed. By sharply reversing motion up and down the length, it can crack its tail like an enormous bullwhip. Louder than a thunderclap, this sonic boom is not only a potent weapon, but also a booming call to other members of the mokele-mbembe&apos;s pack over large distances, summoning them either to share a kill or to defend the group&apos;s young.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAlthough they are most commonly encountered alone, mokele-mbembe form mated pairs to hatch and rear their young once every 3 years. A female lays a clutch of 5 to 6 enormous, hard-shelled eggs in a cavern near the water, with the eggs hatching in 90 days. Mokelembembe young are small upon hatching-no larger than a goat or foal-and are extremely vulnerable during the first 4 to 5 weeks of life. Many fall prey to large snakes, leopards, crocodiles, and even dire bats. It is rare for even half a clutch to survive these initial weeks. Mothers stay close to their young during this time, while the fathers hunt and bring food back to the nest. As hatchlings grow, the father ceases to bring food back from his kills, and instead uses his tail to call both mother and hatchlings to the site of the kill, forcing the young to venture forth to gain food. Mokele-mbembe reach maturity at an alarming rate, growing to full size in just over a year, and reaching reproductive maturity at 2 years of age.\n\nMokele-mbembe occasionally form packs, but only in areas where food is prevalent, as a large pack can kill and eat an entire bloat of hippopotamuses in under a week&apos;s time. Most packs are formed of three to four unrelated males and one to two females close to reproductive age. Scholars have noted that males bring food to a female preparing to lay eggs for fertilization. Females choose their mates from the largest and strongest of pack members, based primarily on who provides the largest offering. Some sages purport that this practice is the genesis of the mokele-mbembe&apos;s feud with hippos, because the fat-heavy water horses provide an abundant energy source for females preparing to reproduce. Once females choose their mates, uncoupled males usually leave the pack to hunt on their own. Surprisingly, the mokele-mbembe males are relatively good-natured in their competition for mating rights, and outside of the desperate race to find more food for a female-a struggle that can sometimes lead to devastating attacks on human villages-the competitors almost never resort to violent displays against each other.\n\nJungle-dwelling elves and humans respect mokele-mbembe for their strength and for the sound of their &#147;thunder.&#148; Lizardfolk, however, revere mokele-mbembe as vessels of divine power, and are the only humanoid race that can successfully train and domesticate them, using them as pack beasts, hunting companions, and battle mounts. Often sharing the same territory, black dragons sometimes use their charm reptiles ability to press mokele-mbembe into servitude, using them as guards for their underwater lairs." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruTrbTotm" name="Tribal Totem" description="Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem.\n\nAs mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically placed within villages to aid against attacks. Others carry stored messages on their tribe&apos;s behalf or vocalize their creator&apos;s words. Rarer still are the tribal totems purposed for war, which emerge from the jungle as a potent force capable of spearheading invasions and targeting enemy champions.\n\nWhile most tribal totems are made of wood and combine exaggerated features of folkloric monsters with simple decorations and images of strength (like streaks of blood, the claws of defeated beasts, or enemy skulls), few look exactly alike, as each embodies the deities, fears, or legends of its creator&apos;s people. Tribal totems tend to stand 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAs constructs, tribal totems have no significant ecological niche. They exist at the whim of their creators and protect their assigned tribes from harm. The divine spark that powers them emanates from the continued adulation and combined spiritual energy of the tribe, but relies upon constant rekindling. Each morning, the totem requires lengthy ritual adoration to renew its power. Otherwise, the totem remains still, appearing to be nothing more than a decorative statue.\n\nDuring elaborate festivals and revels, tribal natives usually spend several hours honoring the totem to ensure it remains vigilant for many days. They also take care to mend and repair any damage it might have suffered on their behalf. Once charged in this manner, the totem may operate remotely for many days at a time, undertaking longer trips on the tribe&apos;s behalf to hunt down enemies whose likeness it acquires.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nTribal shamans, oracles, or witchdoctors most commonly undertake the rituals necessary to construct a tribal totem, guiding the rest of the tribe in worshiping and maintaining it. The totem only obeys the commands of its creator or someone appointed by her. In the event of conflicting orders, it always obeys its creator above anyone else loaned such authority. Typically, a tribal totem spends its entire existence within the confines of its creator&apos;s village, and is completely dependent on the continuing worship of the tribe to give it a semblance of life. Only in rare cases might a multitude of tribes gather their totems together for some shared offensive. Tales also tell of crazed hermits and shamanic outcasts who have created multiple tribal totems and then set them against specific individuals or whole tribes who garner their ire." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruUmasi" name="Umasi" description="Reclusive and shrouded in mystery, the Umasi-or Harvestmen, as they are known across the Mwangi Expanse-are a race of humanoids who exist between life and death. Unable to heal or procreate naturally, the Umasi extend their lives by transplanting the skin, organs, or even entire appendages of other humanoids onto parts of their own bodies. As a result, there is no typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes. The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall. Most weigh between 150 and 300 pounds, and the constant addition of new flesh has left little distinction between genders.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nZenj legends say the Umasi were an ancient tribe of arrogant scholars who lived deep in the Mwangi Jungle. When a powerful witch doctor came to the Umasi seeking their wisdom, he was rebuffed as being unworthy of receiving the Umasi&apos;s knowledge. Enraged, the witch doctor used a taboo ritual to curse the Umasi, stealing away fragments of their very souls and binding them to the flesh of others, forcing them to harvest the bodies of humanoids to sustain a bitterly extended existence. This curse left the Umasi a sterile, afflicted people somewhere between the living and the living dead.\n\nContrary to their appearance, Umasi are living creatures. They eat, breathe, and sleep like other humanoids, but their bodies are in a constant state of decay. This divided nature grants the Harvestmen immunity to disease and resistance to toxins, but even minor injuries don&apos;t heal naturally; Umasi must graft new flesh onto existing tissue to heal their wounds.\n\nStaving off the endless decay of their bodies requires more extreme measures. As limbs and organs rot, Umasi elders use obsidian blades to remove the subject&apos;s decaying parts, replacing them with similar parts from fresh corpses and linking the replacements to the original body through a complex ritual combining ancient Umasi knowledge with the forbidden juju rites of their original curser. When the ritual is complete, the new body part joins perfectly with the Umasi and death is cheated&#226;&#128;&#166; for a time.\n\nIn much the same way, Harvestmen are not born, but made. Barren, infertile, and missing pieces of their souls, Umasi are unable to breed. Their only recourse is to tear off chunks of their own flesh, bind them together with the remains of dead humanoids, and animate the results using the same ancient juju rites.\n\nMany people have sought the secret to the longevity of the Harvestmen, only to be turned away with little explanation. Because the joining ritual requires one to give away a part of his soul willingly, the Umasi only accept those ready to make such a dire compact because they have no other choice. The Harvestmen only give their &#147;gift&#148; to humanoids who find themselves at the edge of death, whether from a grievous wound or some magically resistant affliction or disease. During the ritual, a piece of the dying humanoid is exchanged with a corresponding piece of an Umasi &#147;donor.&#147; Once the stitches are sewn, the dying creature&apos;s wounds are healed, and he joins the ranks of the Harvestmen forevermore.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nUmasi society is as much a patchwork as its members. Some live off the jungle, hunting and farming as they did before the curse. Other tribes lead sedentary lives, trading ancient artifacts of the first Umasi with explorers in exchange for needed goods. Umasi have no organized leadership or traditional families, and children are unheard of among their kind. Regardless, all Umasi tribes form around a council of elders.\n\nWhile some Umasi still dwell deep in the Mwangi Jungle amid the skeletal ruins of their former kingdom, the majority of the Harvestmen have spread to the Kaava Lands and the Screaming Jungle, distancing themselves from the memory of their curse. Umasi are reclusive wherever they dwell, preferring to stay on the fringes of settlements. Although they need humanoid flesh to survive, most Umasi kill only as a last resort, taking flesh from the newly dead instead. This practice often stigmatizes them further, with other races considering them little more than grave robbers. A few Umasi embrace their near immortality in a darker way, viewing other humanoids as prey. These Harvestmen roam the Bandu Hills with undead ghouls, hunting travelers and harvesting what they wish, sometimes before their victims are even dead.\n\nHowever, some Umasi use their peculiar nature to live harmoniously with other humanoids. Pathfinders tell of human villages where Umasi act as gravediggers during plague outbreaks. Their immunity to disease allows the Harvestmen to safely dispose of infected corpses, while at the same time gaining the flesh they need and also garnering goodwill from those they help.\n\nHarvestmen rarely fight with other races, but competition over resources like water or hunting grounds can cause conflict, and those knowingly trespassing on Umasi land may court their anger. When driven to combat, Umasi are extremely dangerous, laying ambushes for enemies and swarming their targets in the hope of harvesting their strength. With their obsidian blades, Harvestmen can punch through the chest cavities of helpless or dying humanoids to extract vital organs. Any Umasi who consumes these pieces of their victims gains a ferocious surge of power, turning the tide of even a desperate battle.\n\nAll Harvestmen know the heavy price they pay to cheat death. Some, over the lonely centuries, have come to regret their existence, roaming the lengths of the Mwangi Expanse and beyond in search of powerful magic to free them from their curse. Sadly, no mortal magic has yet proven strong enough to undo the fell curse of the Umasi." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruObambo" name="Obambo" description="When a person wise in the lore of the jungle dies and is not buried or given a funeral, the jungle itself may embrace her spirit, creating an obambo (&#147;forsaken one&#148;). The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of plants, and the crawling things beneath, becoming one with the jungle itself. An obambo is cunning, spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo is dangerous, they are known to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the obambo&apos;s price.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAn obambo may rise when a tribal elder or shaman perishes in the wild and is never properly laid to rest. Without the proper rites to lead the spirit into the afterlife, the obambo is lost and sundered from its community and tribe, cursed to wander the wild. If the obambo&apos;s place of death can be discovered and its remains returned for proper burial (usually in a small house-like shrine on the land of a blood relative), its spirit is laid to rest forever, but few obambos ever find such peace. Instead, whispered memories drive the obambo to meander endlessly between jungle villages, all vaguely familiar but none ever seeming right. An obambo may be male or female.\n\nObambos are solitary wanderers of the bush and veldt. Animals shy away from them, but obambos share a keen spiritual symbiosis with vermin and plants. Through an obambo&apos;s journeys, these are its audience, attending faithfully to the obambo&apos;s endless tales and treating it as a wise mentor and leader. Their obeisance, however, can never satisfy the obambo&apos;s yearning for the rapt attention of its former humanoid kind to its riddles, stories, and lessons. An obambo is easily angered by the foolish, however, and its stern reproofs often leave its pupils as drooling husks or mindless insectile drones. An obambo&apos;s plant or vermin sycophants have been known to devour such hapless wretches, or even to ravage entire villages as they sit enthralled by the obambo&apos;s tales. As long as a few survivors remain and learn from the obambo&apos;s teaching, it is satisfied. In any case, an angry obambo hardly needs assistance in the act of destruction, as an obambo&apos;s spiritual communion with the land enables it to merge itself into the land, rising up as a roaring titan melded of soil, mud, vegetation, and crawling vermin.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nObambos often establish a reputation as darkling oracles, wise and knowledgeable about the jungle, its creatures, and its people. They create small shrines to themselves called akinfa, usually in hollow trees where supplicants may bring gifts and the obambo may sit within. These gifts may be of material wealth, but as a teacher, the obambo prefers gifts that show the talents of the supplicant, be it a crafted item, a song, a story, a riddle, or some other performance.\n\nAn obambo begins any meeting as unfriendly, but a supplicant may make a Craft or Perform check opposed by the obambo&apos;s Appraise skill to offer a gift he has made (offering a magical or masterwork item grants a +2 circumstance bonus on this check). If the supplicant succeeds, the obambo is impressed with his skill and its attitude becomes indifferent. If the check fails, the obambo remains unfriendly, and if failed by 10 or more, the obambo is insulted and becomes hostile. If a creature offers an item the creature did not personally create, the obambo is entitled to a Sense Motive check opposed by the supplicant&apos;s Craft or Perform check; if it succeeds, the obambo becomes hostile. An obambo is unaffected by Diplomacy until it receives a suitable gift.\n\nAn indifferent obambo&apos;s attitude may be improved with Diplomacy or by offering additional gifts as above; each gift that pleases the obambo improves its attitude by one step. Using Intimidate against the obambo makes it immediately hostile, as does any unsuccessful Bluff attempt. An obambo can also be challenged to a storytelling contest. The contest is resolved by a Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) check opposed by the obambo&apos;s Perform (oratory) check; if the PC wins, the obambo is truly impressed and immediately becomes helpful.\n\nEach time a supplicant tries to influence the obambo&apos;s attitude beyond indifferent, it responds with a question or riddle, using its Bluff skill or one of its Knowledge skills; the supplicant must oppose the check with the same skill. Each time a supplicant fails this opposed check, the obambo becomes annoyed and all skill checks to influence him take a -2 circumstance penalty for 1 hour.\n\nAn indifferent obambo answers questions in riddles, requiring a Sense Motive check opposed by the obambo&apos;s Bluff check for the PC to understand what the creature means. A friendly obambo speaks more plainly, and visitors generally do not need to make opposed checks to determine its meaning. It may offer goodberries to supplicants who have offered it additional gifts. A helpful obambo answers questions clearly, and may also agree to use one of its spell-like abilities to aid the supplicant. However, an obambo expects gratitude and an additional gift after it lends its aid. If no gift is forthcoming, or the supplicant requests another favor, the obambo flies into a rage at the ingratitude and attacks." compset="Race">

A tikoloshe&apos;s undead traits and resistance to f ire make it an ideal servant for many tasks. Some are forced to mine rare minerals deep underwater or to capture exotic elemental creatures on fiery planes. Other creators use tikoloshe as sinister pawns to curse or even kill hated adversaries.\n\nOnce released from servitude, tikoloshe prefer to inhabit waterways and shallow seabeds where they can rest undisturbed and where they can surprise travelers, fisherfolk, and swimmers. When partially submerged, a tikoloshe&apos;s body merges with the surrounding water, making it difficult to see and battle.\n\nWhen not near water, tikoloshe dwell in shallow holes under rocks and large trees, and even under porches and raised buildings in small villages. While their bodies do not require food to sustain themselves, tikoloshe enjoy stalking and eating smaller creatures like birds, frogs, and rabbits. They particularly relish killing monkeys, as they enjoy the nearly human screams the unfortunate animals make. Tikoloshe will sometimes make ghastly fetishes of their kills and leave them on the fences or doorsteps of local settlements to hint at their presence and cause fear among those they seek to torment. As a result, many jungle tribes place rare or semiprecious stones on the thresholds of their homes as an offering for tikoloshe to eat, claiming that doing so protects that home against the creature&apos;s wrath. Although some scholars dismiss such practices as abject superstition, druids and clerics of the Mwangi Expanse assert that by ingesting a potent fragment of earth, tikoloshe are able to soothe the opposing elemental forces within them and thus still their malevolent nature.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nTikoloshe form gangs and clans whenever possible, knowing that their ability to cause mayhem is greater in numbers. Individually, they haunt inhabited areas using their invisibility to cause strange, uncanny incidents like unlocking doors to animal pens, moving and breaking household objects, and spoiling food. Tikoloshe often use their curse to bestow bad luck on those that they haunt. Watching from their invisible perches, from beneath beds, and even from inside closets and cupboards, the tikoloshe take spiteful glee in observing those whom they have rendered suddenly clumsy, weak, or otherwise inept as they fumble even the simplest of tasks.\n\nMany tikoloshe use their powers for more than mischief, however, and can prove a serious threat to both residents and travelers of the Mwangi Expanse. When fighting as a pack or clan, tikoloshe use their rapid swimming to close with foes, quickly swarming a single target and dragging it underwater. On land, groups of tikoloshe use invisibility to get close to opponents, seeking to curse as many enemies as possible before losing the element of surprise. They are cunning enough to use physically debilitating curses on heavily armed folk and mind-harming curses on those who they think might be spellcasters.\n\nIndividual tikoloshe always try to f lee when faced with organized resistance. If tracked or cornered, tikoloshe plead for their lives by offering a service to their captors, usually the same one that was exacted from them upon their creation. Those who accept a tikoloshe&apos;s offer may indeed benefit from the creature&apos;s service, but they must also be very cautious, as tikoloshe are not bound by any promises they make once their original commitment to their creator has been fulfilled. Cunning tikoloshe are known to barter their services for their lives, but only to buy enough time for their new masters to turn their backs.\n\n{b}Variant Tikoloshe{/b}\nDepending on the ritual used and the quality of the materials, some tikoloshe look different than the standard dwarf-gremlin variety. Some look like horrid Small werebears in hybrid form, or like a worm-like creature with a dog&apos;s head and golden tongue. These variants may or may not have the burned-out eyeholes of the &#147;standard&#148; tikoloshe.\n\n{b}Creating Tikoloshe{/b}\nThe process of creating a tikoloshe is more complex than for animating most undead creatures, but requires the same fundamental magic. Ultimately, the creation process culminates in the casting of the spell create undead. In addition to the normal components of the spell, creating a tikoloshe requires the equipment and process previously noted, adding 1 day of effort and 100 gold pieces to the typical requirements of the spell. Typically, a caster loses control over a tikoloshe after the undead performs one service for him, though creators of level 15 or higher retain control." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruArcanoth" name="Arcanotheign" description="The Arcanotheign is a mysterious creature serving the mad god Nethys. Because her creator sends her to Golarion on missions to heal, destroy, or spy, she is familiar with creatures of the mortal world, yet still very much an outsider, and she is fascinated by the intricacies of mortal interactions and history. In her natural, incorporeal form, she is a storm of magic, immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. Ever curious, she often asks personal, direct questions of those she is sent to interact with, even as she repairs their wounds or tears their souls from their bodies. Sometimes she is told to assume a physical form, and lives among humanoids as a mysterious oracle for days or weeks, observing those near her and giving cryptic answers to those who dare approach her. She stands just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the ground instead of walking.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe Arcanotheign understands she is foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the same place, she may &#147;adopt&#148; those living near her, especially orphaned ones. Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children, though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect it or return it home than to ignore or harm it. Some of these children develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAs a supernatural creature created in a moment of lucidity by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own devices when her master does not need her, and wanders Golarion and the planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get information from her. Her affection for animals is related to this; they are simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

Increased effect: The creature is banished as if under the effect of a maze spell.\n\nIgnite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage every round on the herald&apos;s turn for the next 10 rounds.

  <thing id="ruInkanyam" name="Inkanyamba" description="Sometimes called elder serpents, inkanyambas are enormous, malevolent snake-like creatures that dwell in tropical lakes and deep jungle rivers. Measuring over 60 feet long and weighing nearly 3,000 pounds, an inkanyamba resembles a dense snake with a vaguely crocodilian head, filled with multiple sets of fangs of varying lengths. Its long body is covered in multicolored scales that range from emerald green to golden and even vermilion. Males have larger hoods than females, who also have small, pointed frills running the length of their bodies.\n\nInkanyambas live for centuries; their maximum possible lifespan is unknown.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLarger than the biggest constrictors and possessing more venom than a hundred asps, the inkanyamba combines the deadliest and most efficient predatory traits of serpentkind with a diabolical intelligence. Able to attack from the water or the land, an inkanyamba is always the top predator in its region, capable of devouring prey as large and formidable as rhinos, dire crocodiles, and even elephants. Sages once thought that the inkanyamba&apos;s elongated head was evidence of the creature being crossed with some other species, suggesting magic in the inkanyamba&apos;s origin. In reality, the inkanyamba&apos;s long skull is necessary to house the numerous glands storing the creature&apos;s venom. Once thought to be a shifting, mutating poison, the inkanyamba actually carries several different toxins in its body, each type linked to a different set of fangs within the creature&apos;s mouth. Making this ability even more potent, all inkanyambas have a latticework of small sensory organs inside their mouths and throughout their bodies in the small spaces between scales. When an inkanyamba makes physical contact with a living creature, these sensory organs detail the target&apos;s physiology in a manner that allows the inkanyamba to know which of its many types of venom would be deadliest. Additionally, special ducts on the inside of the inkanyamba&apos;s frontmost fangs allow the creature to spray gouts of venom up to great distances. Although an inkanyamba can only spit a single life-sapping venom, this spray needs only to make contact with a target to take effect and can blind victims caught in its blast.\n\nEven without their fabled variety of poisons, inkanyambas are capable predators. When an inkanyamba unfurls its massive hood and sways back and forth, a scintillating pattern of multi-hued scales on the inside of the creature&apos;s neck can cause a hypnotic state in those that observe it. Inkanyambas often use this ability to approach targets on land or when confronted with multiple enemies. Once a target has been bitten, an inkanyamba can throw the rest of its body forward like a coiled rope, biting and then wrapping the victim in the creature&apos;s crushing body.\n\nInkanyambas dwell near large lakes and deep rivers. Such locations not only allow them to attack from the cover of water, but inkanyambas also lair in underwater caves where pockets of air have become trapped. Such nests are inaccessible to most intruders and allow the great serpents to slumber safely after gorging themselves.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nInkanyambas are solitary creatures except for the brief couplings that occur during mating. They favor areas that are populated by both animal life and human settlements. Pathfinders chronicling the history of the Mwangi Expanse have recounted instances of human and lizardfolk tribes alike revering inkanyambas as gods. In such cases, the monsters use their ability to control the weather and call up storms to create false portents that instill awe in the local inhabitants, extorting offerings and even living sacrifices from their terrified &#147;subjects.&#148;\n\nCruel, malicious, and accustomed to being worshiped, inkanyambas are likely to attack anything they perceive as a threat. When facing well-prepared or powerful opponents, inkanyambas retreat deep beneath the closest body of water to exert their control over weather, using high winds to ground airborne opponents and thunderstorms to bolster their ability to summon lightning. If threatened, inkanyambas prefer escape to surrender, but some have been known to parlay with powerful groups of adventurers, usually to help the serpent acquire an item that it cannot gain for itself. Such offers, however, are never genuine, as all inkanyambas seek only their own selfish ends.\n\nIn the depths of the Mwangi Expanse, the Zenj have a saying: &#147;Speaking to an inkanyamba only gives it time to encircle you.&#148;" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruUmdhlebi" name="Umdhlebi" description="Umdhlebis are massive, intelligent, and carnivorous plants that take root in jungles. Their outer shell is brown and resembles the thick bark of a dead tree, while concealing the softer layer of green cellulose beneath. When they flower, umdhlebis grow broad, fragile-looking crimson leaves with sharp, grasping edges. Umdhlebis draw their prey close with mind-affecting suggestions, enticing would-be victims to rest at the plant&apos;s base, and then strike with their vine-like tendrils, each as thick as a man&apos;s forearm.\n\nUmdhlebis grow to almost 20 feet in height, but can be shorter or taller depending on the surrounding vegetation. An umdhlebi&apos;s trunk ranges from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, and the plant as a whole weighs over 10,000 pounds.\n\nUmdhlebis can live for up to 50 years.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLegends say that the first umdhlebi was created when an assassin vine crawled into the hollow corpse of a slain, jungle-dwelling treant. The creatures fused together, returning the treant to life, but instilling in it a devastating hunger. Regardless of its true origins, the umdhlebi is known and feared throughout the jungles of the world. Resembling a tree with a hard outer coating, the umdhlebi is actually an intelligent and mobile plant, capable of uprooting itself to find food or escape danger. Although ambulatory, the umdhlebi is too slow to truly hunt and has evolved several methods to attract prey. An umdhlebi uses its large vines and brightly colored leaves to draw in animals and other creatures of lesser intelligence. Once in range, the umdhlebi lashes out with its strong, vine-like tendrils, enveloping and crushing its prey with bone-shattering force. Umdhlebis, however, prefer to feed on humanoids and can compel even the most strongminded individuals to approach their waiting snares. When sensing a nearby humanoid, an umdhlebi vibrates rows of fine, cilia-like hairs along its trunk, producing a sound that targets the minds of any close enough to hear it. This enticing drone causes those under its sway to approach the base of the tree where the umdhlebi can strike. Although the majority of an umdhlebi grows aboveground, the creature&apos;s mouth and digestive system are just below the surface. Large, thick roots at the base provide stability and allow for movement, but between these larger roots and beneath the umdhlebi&apos;s central trunk exists a populous network of long, thin stems. Each of these growths ends in double-sided fronds lined with spine-like teeth, similar to the leaves of a flytrap. When an umdhlebi roots itself to the ground, these stems burrow up to breach the surrounding earth, forming a moss-like border around the larger roots. Fresh kills are thus devoured from beneath, as the umdhlebi&apos;s understems feed. Numbering in the thousands, the umdhlebi&apos;s tiny mouths can strip a human carcass to its bones in under an hour, and although these under-stems are too small to effectively damage foes in melee, their shifting, undulating motion of makes traversing the ground around an umdhlebi difficult.\n\nUmdhlebis produce a spiny red fruit twice a year. This fruit appears similar to the seed pods of chestnut trees, but instead of holding tough seeds, it contains a bland meat riddled with dozens of triangular seeds. While wellfed umdhlebis sometimes allow monkeys and birds to pluck their fruit and carry it to new ground, they often use their own tendrils to pick and fling the fruit where they please. Some stories tell of undhlebis braining wanderers with these dense pods, or of passersby warned of the dangerous plants by their flying fruit, but these seasonal growths never reliably serve as weapons or warnings. Some tribes maintain dangerous traditions of seeking out and collecting undhlebi fruit to use in the creation of mashes or alcohols. Such products possess a distinctive dry-bitter taste and so are only prepared for use in coming-of-age rituals or other rites of passage.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nUmdhlebis root themselves along roads and waterways near humanoid settlements whenever possible. As their roots are highly sensitive to vibrations and can detect the movement of other nearby creatures, they can stay out of sight, despite their size, and still be aware of their surroundings.\n\nAs the dry shell of their outer layer is particularly susceptible to fire, umdhlebis always entwine themselves with surrounding foliage so that any such attacks against them also risk setting the entire wilderness ablaze. If threatened and such cover is not available, umdhlebis use their compelling whisper ability to manipulate one or more opponents and then draw them in to surround the plant&apos;s trunk, using them as living shields. Although they have no use for treasure, umdhlebis pile any leftover items from their prey into the base of their trunks as bait for passersby.\n\nWhen an umdhlebi moves on to other hunting grounds, it sheds its fruit first, hoping that the seeds will take hold and grow. Denizens of the Mwangi Expanse and other jungles are taught to recognize and burn umdhlebi seeds from an early age. Nevertheless, some umdhlebi seeds do make their way into the earth and take root, reaching maturity with frightening speed." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruEmprScls" name="Emperor of Scales" description="In the earliest days of the Age of Serpents, when the great serpentfolk empire was young, the serpentfolk were ruled by a single, powerful priest-king. When Ydersius took his rightful place as god of the serpentfolk, he exalted this priest-king above all others, raising the king up to become his foremost servant and herald. With his original name long lost to memory, the first king of the serpentfolk empire became known as the Emperor of Scales.\n\nWith Ydersius&apos;s still-living head entombed beneath the earth and his mindless body endlessly wandering the Darklands, the Emperor of Scales is the snake-god&apos;s primary representative on Golarion. Unable to take direct action on his own, Ydersius relies upon his herald to enact his will on the Material Plane. The Emperor of Scales embodies the fall of the mighty serpentfolk empire from its previous heights, and personifies the rage of Ydersius himself, trapped and sundered into two lesser parts. But he also represents the god&apos;s immortality, for even in defeat Ydersius was not slain, and even without a body, the Emperor of Scales still serves.\n\nThe Emperor of Scales does not speak, but it can communicate telepathically. Snakes and serpents of all kinds and sizes flock to the Emperor of Scales, who can enslave them to his will. The Emperor of Scales appears as a giant snake&apos;s head about 20 feet long, and weighs close to 5 tons. His serpentine tendrils extend another 15 feet behind and around his head.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nWhen Ydersius was whole and walked Golarion as the god of the serpentfolk empire, the Emperor of Scales appeared as a giant serpentfolk warrior clad in golden scale armor who strode across ancient battlefields wielding spells and blade with equal precision. When Ydersius was beheaded by the Azlanti heroine Savith and cast down, the Emperor of Scales suffered his own mutilation. In a sympathetic reflection of his master&apos;s fate, the Emperor&apos;s head tore itself free from his body, growing to monstrous size while his humanoid body quickly withered away. His eyes clouded over, blinding the herald, but the tendrils of flesh that once attached his head to his body transformed into a multitude of hissing, poisonous vipers. The Emperor of Scales has kept that form since, but the faithful of Ydersius believe that when the snake-god is restored, so too will his herald return to his original form and once more lead the serpentfolk armies to victory.\n\nOriginally born on Golarion, the Emperor of Scales is a native outsider. He sleeps like any normal creature, and when not called upon to serve, spends most of his time in a dream-filled torpor, much like the severed head of Ydersius himself. Unlike other native outsiders, however, the Emperor of Scales does not need to eat. As he no longer has a body to process and digest food, he gains sustenance from his divine link with Ydersius. On other planes, the Emperor of Scales gains the extraplanar subtype, and requires neither food nor sleep.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAt the height of Ydersius&apos;s power, the Emperor of Scales divided his time between Golarion and Ydersius&apos;s planar realm, the pocket plane of Sydrixus deep in the unending chaos of the Maelstrom. Since Ydersius&apos;s defeat, that realm has been closed to both the god and his servants, and like Ydersius, the Emperor of Scales has been confined to the Material Plane. In the millennia since, the Emperor of Scales has traveled throughout the Material Plane, alternately searching the Darklands of Golarion for the sundered skull and body of Ydersius, or sleeping for centuries, dreaming of his master&apos;s restoration and return.\n\nThe Emperor of Scales has been encountered numerous times over the ages in various abandoned cities of the ancient serpentfolk, both on Golarion, and some say, on other worlds as well. Powerful priests of Ydersius have been known to wake the Emperor of Scales when they find him and request his aid. Such alliances are usually short-lived, however, as the herald inevitably moves on in search of his lost master.\n\nThe Emperor of Scales is known to work with demons on occasion, though those fiends serving Abraxas are viewed as enemies, and the herald does not hesitate to attack and destroy them, returning them to their Abyssal realm.\n\nIn his original form, the Emperor of Scales frequently mated with mortal serpentfolk and left behind countless semidivine progeny. What happened to these paragons of the serpentfolk race after the fall of the serpentfolk empire is unknown, although many powerful serpentfolk priests claim descent from the herald to bolster their own influence. These days, exceptionally large or particularly strong snakes are said to be the brood of the Emperor of Scales, remnants of his serpentine tendrils that were severed in battle and took on a life of their own. Whether or not these claims are true is of little importance-certainly the Emperor of Scales himself seems unconcerned with such potential offspring." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruHolSerpL" name="Hollow Serpent, Lesser" description="Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk&apos;s age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.\n\nA typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAs undead creatures, hollow serpents require nothing in the way of sustenance, but their voracious appetite for the life-energy of living creatures is well documented in the annals of Azlanti and serpentfolk lore. The temporary energy derived from their life-draining coils sends most hollow serpents into a feeding frenzy. And their lifesense ability helps them search out even the most well-hidden prey. Much like the predator snakes they mimic, hollow serpents enjoy the hunt and may stalk living creatures for days through the subterranean passageways of the Darklands or the ruined cities of the serpentfolk.\n\nOnly the high priests of Ydersius know the proper rituals and ceremonies to infuse a shedding with enough divine magic to awaken it into a hollow serpent. However, a hollow serpent also possesses the means to create lesser offspring from its own desiccated flesh. These lesser hollow serpents are much smaller and limited in power, but their undersized nature allows them to venture into passageways a larger hollow serpent could never reach. Serpentfolk priests have also learned how to create these lesser hollow serpents using snakeskin sheddings from normal constrictor snakes, imbuing them with unlife as temple guardians.\n\nTo spawn a lesser hollow serpent, a hollow serpent must undergo a molting cycle that lasts 3 months. Prior to this hibernation, it must also inflict no less than nine negative levels on living creatures, storing up the temporary energy from these life-draining attacks to pass onto its new offspring. Thereafter, the hollow serpent sheds a piece of its own skin, which then grows into a lesser hollow serpent.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nHollow serpents have little in the way of society or culture of their own. Beholden to the snake-god, who grants their existence, they exist only to serve and defend the serpentfolk species. Lesser hollow serpents spawned by a hollow serpent intuitively stay near their progenitor-somehow interconnected through the negative energy and siphoned life forces shared between them. Spellcasters who create a lesser hollow serpent on their own may only command its loyalty if capable of commanding undead.\n\n{b}Creating a Hollow Serpent{/b}\nWhile the first hollow serpents were supposedly created from scales shed by beasts favored by the Serpent King himself, and those unholy snakeskins can even shed their own lesser offspring over time, serpentfolk priests can also create their own lesser hollow serpents. A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15th-level caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents." compset="Race">
