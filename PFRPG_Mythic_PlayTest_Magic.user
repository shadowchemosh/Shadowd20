  <thing id="cfgMyMagic" name="Mythic Magic" description="Some spells can be enhanced by those with mythic power. By adding even the merest fraction of their power to the spells as they cast them, mythic casters make these spells vastly more potent. A spellcaster doesn&apos;t need to learn these spells as he would others, but must unlock the secret of using mythic power with these spells either through a feat (like Mythic Spells) or through a feature of his mythic path.\n\nThe following spells have an enhanced effect if the caster expends one use of mythic power at the time of casting. This does not increase the level of the spell or its casting time. In addition, some spells have an even greater effect that can be accessed only by casters of a high enough mythic tier who expend an additional amount of mythic power. These spells have a &amp;quot;Greater&amp;quot; entry that includes an additional cost in uses of mythic power (on top of the one use spent to use the mythic version of the spell in the first place).\n\nIn addition to the listed effects, a few overall rules that apply to all spells cast with mythic power.\n\n{b}Potent{/b}: The DC to save against any spell enhanced with mythic power in this way increases by 2. In addition, the caster receives a +2 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.\n\n{b}Resilient{/b}: A spell cast with mythic power can&apos;t be counterspelled unless the opposing spellcaster also expends one use of mythic power. In such a case, the normal rules for counterspelling apply. In addition, any check made to dispel a spell enhanced by mythic power is made at a -4 penalty." compset="Configure" uniqueness="unique">
