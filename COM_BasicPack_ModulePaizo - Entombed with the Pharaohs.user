Summoning the barbarians is a swift action you can activate with a thought, rather than by blowing a horn.\n\nThe mask's greater power, however, is to summon forth the missing portion of the pyramid of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension (see Part 3).\n\nShould the PCs defeat all four of the pharaohs, the mask shatters into four jagged pieces and is destroyed." compset="Wondrous">

The more artful interrogators of Cheliax well understand that their subjects soon learn to welcome unconsciousness and even death as a means to escape torture. To frustrate their victim's respite, a torturer's wracking rod delivers a painful jolt that keeps the target alert for an extended session of interrogation. On a successful touch attack, the victim receives the benefit of a cure light wounds spell (1d8+1) but must also make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d4 rounds. Over the decades, desperate members of Cheliax's underclass have found that these rods double as black market sources of emergency healing.

Wand rifles are frequently outfitted with serrated bayonets, which share the statistics of short swords. Using a wand rifle properly (either with a ray or with its bayonet) requires the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat.
