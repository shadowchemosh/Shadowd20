  <thing id="tmUmTwoHea" name="Two-Headed" description="A two-headed creature is one skull up on a one-headed version of the same thing. It might be a freak of nature (possibly showing signs of deformity), a superior individual marked by the gods (often showing unusual coloring or marks upon it), or an example of a separate, if related, species (as ettins are to ogres and hill giants).\n\nTwo-headed creatures gain a bit more offensive power, but aren&apos;t any harder to kill than their monocranial cousins. Thus most are +1 CR, though those with breath weapons or gaze attacks (anything for which the Two Heads are Better ability applies) become +2 CR due to the increased danger.  {b}Note:{/b} This ability is not implemented.\n\n{b}Double Bite (Ex):{/b} If the base creature has a bite attack, it now has two bite attacks.\n\n{b}Improved Multiple Attacks (Ex):{/b} Because the two-headed creature has two brains, it can easily control multiple attacks without penalty.
