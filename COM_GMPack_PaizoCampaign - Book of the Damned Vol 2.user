  <thing id="stNasDemLd" name="Nascent Demon Lord" description="When a demon of any race grows powerful enough, by advancing in Hit Dice, taking class levels, or simply gaining strange powers and abilities from eldritch sources in the Abyss, it undergoes a new transformation. Just as the demons themselves are shaped from the raw materials of sin-gorged larvae, demon lords are formed from powerful individual demons. Yet with very few exceptions, a full-fledged lord is never born fully formed-instead, each must build power and resources during an extended period of transformation. Demons in this transitional stage are known as nascent demon lords.\n\nThe means by which a demon can become a nascent demon lord are as varied as the lords themselves. Some might make this transformation simply by achieving a certain level in a prestige class. Others might need to undertake a strange ritual, while still others must conquer Abyssal realms and subjugate armies of fiends. It is the Abyss itself that makes the decision on whether a demon deserves to begin the transformation to lord-sometimes with the aid and blessing of a current lord serving as a mentor or patron, while other times in abject defiance of a demon lord actively working to prevent a loathed minion from making this first step to greater power.\n\nAt any one time, there exist hundreds if not thousands of nascent demon lords on the Abyss. The vast majority of these are comparatively new and will not last for long-competition and conf lict between nascent demon lords is common, and wars work well to ensure only the strongest survive. While nascent demon lords might superficially resemble the types of demons they used to be, the longer they exist and the closer they grow to full apotheosis as demon lords, the more unique in shape and power they become.\n\nDemon lords themselves are full demigods, and as mentioned earlier in this book, if they were to be fully statted out, they would likely have CR scores of 30 or higher. Foes of this strength are not appropriate for use in the majority of campaigns, yet the campaign wherein the PCs strive against and eventually face off against a powerful and unique demon is an iconic plotline. This is the role nascent demon lords are built for.\n\nA nascent demon lord ranges in power from CR 21 to CR 25, and as such works perfectly as a final foe at the end of a full campaign, with a 20th-level party facing off against the demon in a climactic battle. The best way to build stats for a nascent demon lord is to build them from scratch, customizing them entirely using the rules in Appendix 1 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. When building a CR 21 to CR 25 creature in this manner, you should use the table below in the same way you'd use Table 1-1 on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary as a series of benchmarks to strive for.\n\nNascent demon lords can also grant boons, but their boons are less complex than those granted by full demon lords, manifesting only as spell-like abilities usable once each per day.\n\nWhatever powers and abilities a nascent demon lord possesses, all of them possess the following traits in common. These traits replace the normal demon traits, in many cases with more powerful variants of the typical demon racial traits.\n\nNascent Demon Lord Traits: A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. The typical nascent demon lord traits are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.\n\n&#149; Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison.\n\n&#149; Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.\n\n&#149; Summon (Sp) Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or less. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.\n\n&#149; Telepathy 300 ft.\n\n&#149; A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.\n\n&#149; Nascent demon lords can grant spells to divine spellcasters who worship them. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to a favored weapon and the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests." compset="Subtype" uniqueness="unique">
