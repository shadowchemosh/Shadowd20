  <thing id="fSGBurnVng" name="Burning Vengeance" description="Your touch of corruption can set the world ablaze.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Touch of corruption class feature.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}:  Creatures that fail their saving throws against your touch of corruption catch on fire. The target takes 1d6 points of fire damage immediately. In each subsequent round, the burning character must make a Reflex saving throw at the same DC as the touch of corruption’s Fortitude save. Failure means the target takes another 1d6 points of damage that round. Success means that the fire has gone out—that is, once the target succeeds on his saving throw, he’s no longer on fire.\n\nIf you use this as an evil act (as antipaladins always do unless they are too dumb to think of it) the damage done to burning creatures increases to 1d8/round and half the damage is acid, rather than fire." compset="Feat" summary="Your touch of corruption can set the world ablaze." uniqueness="useronce">

You must make this choice each time you channel energy. The amount of damage dealt and the DC to halve the damage is otherwise unchanged.  \n\nIf you use this ability as an evil act (the equivalent of casting a spell with the evil descriptor) you also cause creatures that fail their saving throw against your channel to be sickened for 1 round." compset="Feat" summary="You can channel the power of hellfire." uniqueness="useronce">
