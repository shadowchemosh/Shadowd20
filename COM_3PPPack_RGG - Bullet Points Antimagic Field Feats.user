  <thing id="fMAnchrdFl" name="Anchored Field" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Ability to cast antimagic field*, Spell Focus (transmutation).\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast antimagic field, you may anchor it to a point in space (rather than have it centered on you) by using a crystal as a material component. The crystal must have a minimum cost equal to the level of the spell squared x10 gp. Like any material component, the crystal is consumed in the casting of the spell. You may also use this feat to anchor other spells, including {i}antilife shell, antiplant shell, arcane concordance, detect scrying, globe of invulnerability (and the greater and lesser versions), locate object, repel vermin, repulsion, seek thoughts, zone of silence{/i}, and (at the GM&#146;s discretion) other spells with an area defined as an emanation centered on you and a duration greater than instantaneous. Those spells that give you information about things happening within them (such as {i}detect scrying{/i} and {i}seek thoughts{/i}) continue to send you that information as long as you are one the same plane as the spell effect.\n\n*Or another spell that may be modified by this feat." compset="Feat" summary="Through the use of special rituals and crystals, you can tie an antimagic field (and some other emanations) to a location rather than center it on yourself." uniqueness="useronce">
