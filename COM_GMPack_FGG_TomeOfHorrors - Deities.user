  <thing id="deiuTsatho" name="Tsathogga" description="This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and decay that he represents. He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Tsathogga makes his home on both Tarterus and the Abyss, spending equal amounts of time in both places. His lair is a vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows between the two planes.\n\nTsathogga&apos;s main form is of a colossally-bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs and fingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul oils and fluids, which leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He rarely moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures, notably his own vile\nfrog race, the tsathar.\n\nTsathogga is 60 feet long and 40 feet tall. He weighs about 200 tons.\n\nTsathogga prefers to avoid direct combat simply because he usually has better things to do than waste time killing the latest group of would-be demon killers. If threatened or attacked, he usually summons his minions to battle his opponents. If Tsathogga does enter combat, he almost always begins by striking the nearest opponent with his tongue, pulling that foe in and swallowing him. If he is near the muck and filth that permeates his home plane, he likes to dive or bury himself underneath it so if a swallowed opponent does manage to cut his way out of Tsathogga&apos;s gullet, he usually drowns or suffocates before he sees daylight again.\n\n{b}Servants of Tsathogga{/b}\nFollowers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of Tsathogga are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive spells from Tsathogga and are granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Water." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
