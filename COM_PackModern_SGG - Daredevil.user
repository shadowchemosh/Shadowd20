The escapist knows that focusing past the consequences of a serious injury can give her the time to take whatever steps are necessary for her survival, and has learned to delay the onset of nearly any injury or effect. \n\nOnce per day as a free action, an escapist of can delay the damage dealt by a single attack or the effect of a single spell, condition, trap, ability or other effect for a number of rounds equal to half her class level. The decision to delay an effect must be made immediately, and the delayed effect&apos;s duration does not start until after the number of rounds it has been delayed.\n\nFor spending one Hero Point, the escapist can increase the number of times per day, by one.\n\nFor example, Yankee Rose is a 14th level escapist trying to walk a tightrope from a glacier to the Bridge City of Suerbak Kak Dalbaz, when a harpy affects her with a lesser confusion spell, which leaves her confused for 1 round. Not wanting to be confused while on a tightrope, Rose decides to delay the effect for 7 rounds. At the end of that time, the lesser confusion affects her for its full 1 round duration - Rose had better hope she&apos;s off her rope by then!\nA delayed injury or effect can be healed or dispelled normally while it is delayed. If one of Rose&apos;s friends managed to hit her with a dispel magic before the end of her 7-round delay, the lesser confusion might be dispelled before it ever takes effect." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="useronce">

Even when a daredevil consciously knows he is clearly about to die, he draws upon his vast reserve of poise, and performs with a calm and speed most people can only display when practicing their skills in total safety.\n\nOf course no matter how poised a daredevil remains, he can only work within the limits of his mortal frame, and thus faster and more nimble daredevils are able to successfully alter a bad outcome more often than slower members of the class.\n\nA daredevil uses his Hero Points for any dauntless surge abilities. For one Hero Point, a daredevil&apos;s dauntless surge can add a bonus as a swift action to any one attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw he makes. This bonus is +1d6, but cannot exceed the daredevil&apos;s class level (a 1st level daredevil thus receives only a +1 bonus, while a 2nd level daredevil receives a +1 bonus if a &quot;1&quot; is rolled on the 1d6, and a &quot;+2&quot; bonus if a 2-5 is rolled).\n\nA daredevil chooses whether or not to use a dauntless surge after the result of the die roll has been revealed, but before success or failure is determined.\n\nA daredevil may add his dauntless surge to a saving throw against a fear effect as an immediate action. If a daredevil uses his dauntless surge to add a bonus to a saving throw against fear, the value of the bonus is doubled (to a maximum of twice the daredevil&apos;s class level)." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Uses his Hero Points for any dauntless surge abilities" uniqueness="useronce">
