  <thing id="ruWeaselGi" name="Weasel, Giant" description="The weasel family includes a long list of common mammals such as ferrets, minks, ermines, polecats, and stoats. All of them, on rare occasions, produce giant varieties. Opportunistic carnivores, weasels prefer their food live, or at least fresh. To maintain their high metabolism they must consume close to 40% of their body weight per day, so giant weasels hunt a wide variety of creatures. Though generally fearful of sentient creatures, giant weasels aggressively protect their territory.\n\nWeasels fight by attaching themselves to their foes with their sharp incisors and then ripping open their victims&apos; flesh with teeth and claws. Using this tactic, giant weasels can take down large animals, such as elk and moose, and attack other predators if they can take them by surprise.\n\nWeasels can be found in almost any climate, from jungles to the arctic. Exceptional climbers, they are equally at ease moving overland or scrambling up rocky cliffs, and can even swim if necessary. Giant weasels make their homes in abandoned dens and burrows, and often bring back fur from their prey to line nests. Most weasels mate in the spring and give birth to litters of four to 10 young in the early summer.\n\nGiant weasels&apos; coats range from red to brown and sometimes gray; their underbellies are usually a lighter color, often white. They also exhibit a wide variety of markings ranging from stripes to masks, and some molt during the winter, producing a pure white coat. The proportion of the head and jaw varies among various subspecies. During mating season and when frightened, weasels release a pungent musk. Though it&apos;s offensive to most creatures, it&apos;s not debilitating like a skunk&apos;s musk.\n\nIn folk tales and among hunters and trappers, weasels have a reputation for being exceptionally clever. Elders warn of giant weasels making off with human children, just as small weasels steal the eggs of birds. Giant weasels grow to up to 9 feet in length from nose to the base of their tails, which can grow to almost the length of their bodies. They weigh upward of 300 pounds." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruWolfTimb" name="Wolf, Timber" description="Timber wolves range in color from white to gray to pitch black. The largest males can weigh 175 pounds. Timber wolves typically have longer legs and bigger paws to help traverse the difficult terrain in which they live. More importantly, their proportionally larger heads, held up by powerful neck muscles, allow them to drag down sizable herd animals.\n\nHunts begin with a communal howl to unite the pack. They chase their prey over vast distances-sometimes over 50 miles-wearing prey down with fear and exhaustion. Using jaws capable of crushing bones and snapping spines, several timber wolves at a time might latch on to a victim and drag it to the ground. Their speed and pack instincts let them use coordinated attacks, flanking, and hit-and-run maneuvers.\n\nGroup howling helps bind the pack together. The howls can be used for calling the pack to the hunt, determining the location of other pack members, communicating food sources, and even determining social order. Howls can be heard over vast distances and help establish a pack&apos;s territory, which averages 350 square miles.\n\nThe power and majesty of timber wolves inspire many sentient races. For civilized folk, the wolf has come to embody a primitive evil, often playing the role of a villain in fairy tales. This has earned the animal an undeserved reputation for aggression. Among northern peoples, the wolf symbolizes strength and prowess in battle. Many tribes revere wolf totems, and some even claim in their folklore to be originally descended from wolves." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruFrostFir" name="Frost Fir" description="Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world, the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants, citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other creatures.\n\nThe grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.\n\nFrost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nFrost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind. This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status when representing the grove in external matters (see below).\n\nOnce a frost fir&apos;s fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a supply of carcasses for this effort.\n\nFollowing 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member. Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir&apos;s development remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself. Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to mourn their loss.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFrost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time, banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances of their species. Only in times of great conflict do multiple groves join forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight-usually followed by great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs&apos; ire.\n\nWithin frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.\n\n{b}Frost Firs in Alchemy{/b}\nSome alchemists prize frost firs for their sticky resin and easily combustible branches. When used as a component in manufacturing tanglefoot bags, a frost fir&apos;s resin increases the DC of the bag&apos;s Reflex save by 2 and extends the duration of the goo&apos;s entangling effect by 1 round. Frost fir resin can also aid in the crafting of tindertwigs, reducing the Craft DC from 20 to 15 and cutting the raw material cost in half." compset="Race">

House spirits use their compression ability and invisibility to stay out of the sight of those they live among.\n\nOvinniks make their homes in granaries and drying houses. These thin, sleek, black-furred humanoids stand only a foot high. Their eyes and features seem catlike, but they bark like dogs to scare away thieves. No one knows why an ovinnik chooses to take up residence in a particular farm&apos;s threshing house, and few would call on them willingly. A wise farmer placates resident ovinniks with frequent gifts of warm milk, pancakes, or dead roosters. By tradition, before the new year farmers and their families go to the granary to learn their fates for the coming year. The ovinnik touches each of them in turn.

  <thing id="ruWitchcro" name="Witchcrow" description="The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of ill deeds and misfortune, preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims&apos; most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it.\n\nWitchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer&apos;s possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their vanish ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLegends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern, moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic.\n\nGreater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years.\n\nAs a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place. Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life&apos;s reward. Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by the elder witchcrow.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWitchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows most prevalent in Irrisen, where they&apos;ve developed a terrible reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule) both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they find them.\n\nIn witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group&apos;s success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or cast out of the flock entirely." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBearPola" name="Bear, Polar" description="Polar bears swim along frigid coasts and wander icy plains looking for prey. They often eat seals plucked from holes in the ice, but will attack any creature when desperate or provoked. Unlike most animals, polar bears show little fear, and can be dangerous scavengers around arctic settlements. They can easily avoid conflict by plunging into the icy waters, which they often do instead of engaging every threat. A polar bear&apos;s blubber gives it buoyancy, and its long neck keeps its head above water. Oversized paws with webbed toes propel it along steadily, and a polar bear can swim over 100 miles in a single day.\n\nSome arctic clans hunt polar bears as a significant source of food, and use the furs and bones for clothes and vital tools. Many of these cultures hold the bears sacred, and honor their deaths with rituals and ceremonies. Polar bears live, on average, 15–20 years, but arctic peoples have known individual bears that lived as long as 40 years. One of the largest animal predators to stalk the ice, an adult male polar bear can weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, with females weighing 350 to 650 pounds." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruCourageH" name="Courage Heart" description="Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt&apos;s Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a final blade, which trapped her soul within it.\n\nMilani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman&apos;s soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.\n\nAs Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma&apos;s herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald&apos;s strange nature and the recent creation of the final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAs she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or has died. She collects remnants of Galt&apos;s history, such as travel journals about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations and inhabitants.\n\nHaving died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning, Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess&apos; service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives. The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape almost any confinement.\n\nThough she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so, and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no such courtesy and expects immediate compliance.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThough the herald tries hard to not play favorites, she loves Galt and her extended family, and often checks up on her friends and relatives by lurking in mouse or owl form. Milani&apos;s small following and the herald&apos;s recent elevation to immortal status means they both are inclined to push the boundaries of what the divine laws allow for direct intervention on Golarion. To bypass these restrictions and watch over her revolution-corrupted homeland, Courage Heart often asks Milani to incarnate her as a mortal ranger (usually of 4th to 7th level) so she can lend a hand where she is needed. In these incarnations she may be male or female and of nearly any human ethnicity or features, but she generally prefers light armor and wields a morningstar. In this mortal shell, she is more careful with her life-not out of any sense of self-preservation, but because she doesn&apos;t want her death to upset anyone she befriends. She prefers to show up in a settlement, deal with a problem, then leave before there are too many questions.\n\nAmong the other celestial servitors of Milani, Courage Heart is beloved as a comrade and leader. She often gathers teams of like-minded celestials to ambush and slay devils, undead, and minions of Zon-Kuthon, then retires with these comrades to Milani&apos;s realm in Elysium to tell stories of each other&apos;s bravery and virtue." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruDawnPipe" name="Dawn Piper" description="Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers&apos; otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures&apos; eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers&apos; heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nEarly on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the “musicians at the dawn of Creation.” Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.\n\nDawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them-the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nDawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadfly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and influence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily-though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.\n\n{b}Dawn Piper Choirs{/b}\nA choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.\n\nAt the GM&apos;s discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag&apos;s coven possesses. They may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the First World." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruMirrorMa" name="Mirror Man" description="At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen&apos;s eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.\n\nWhile some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their lookingglass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however-any caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man she&apos;s familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don&apos;t know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can&apos;t attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFor centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna&apos;s reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men&apos;s role as the White Witches&apos; secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.\n\nThere is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen&apos;s monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs&apos; presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nThe creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature&apos;s soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature&apos;s memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.\n\n{b}CL{/b} 11th; {b}Price{/b} 24,500 gp\n{b}Requirements{/b} Craft Construct, {i}animate dead, cat&apos;s grace, geas/quest, Irriseni mirror sight, magic jar, sending{/i}, creator must be caster level 11th, soul of a living creature that dies or is slain during the creation process; {b}Skill{/b} Craft (sculpture) DC 17 or Heal DC 17; {b}Cost{/b} 12,500 gp" compset="Race">

  <thing id="tmuWinterF" name="Winter Fey" description="Infused with the primal power of winter&apos;s chill, a winter fey possesses the power to freeze its victims with a mere touch. It is said that this wintery power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature&apos;s nature and infusing it with hatred and spite. While a winter fey is visually recognizable as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered. Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts, but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nFound mainly in the reaches of the far north and the frigid regions of the First World, winter fey live in places far too cold for most humanoids to survive without magical assistance. The harsh landscape and bone-chilling climate match the hearts of these bitter creatures. A winter fey found far from cold lands is typically acting on the orders of a liege or in pursuit of an especially wily victim, as few choose to wander so close to the “hot lands” without a particular purpose in mind. However, winter fey have been known to travel deep into warmer climates in order to play a worthy enough trick on a creature.\n\nSome winter fey are known to move south every winter in search of new creatures to steal from, torment, or maim. As cruel as a winter storm, a winter fey feels no remorse for those it hurts. For its own amusement, a winter fey leads its victims far from civilization without any means to protect themselves from the elements and then abandon them, typically leaving them to freeze to death. Such a fey creature targets the innocent and gullible simply for sinister laughs, spending months crafting an exceptional ruse and then watching it play out. Savoring such delicious cruelty is what winter fey live for.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nOn Golarion, winter fey live in the cold northern realms, staying far away from the heat of summer. When winter strikes, these malevolent creatures sometimes migrate south with the snowstorms, then return to the north as quickly as they came, at the first sign of the spring thaw.\n\nBeing able to craft an original and depraved trick upon a creature and share the tale of that trick is how a winter fey gains respect and ultimately a greater status among its peers. Once a winter fey plays a trick upon a creature, that creature is considered marked. Although it is not forbidden to trick a creature marked by another winter fey, young winter fey caught doing so are looked on as sloppy and unoriginal. As such, young winter fey are constantly looking for new creatures upon whom to let their wicked imaginations run wild, while their elders poach their marked targets. Sometimes winter fey work together to pull off a truly heinous yet epic trick. One of the bestknown times that a group of winter fey worked together like this involved a bloody carnival of torture and death.\n\nA winter fey&apos;s characteristic icy claws are frequently stained with blood. Winter fey love nothing more than to feel the suffering they cause with their own frosty hands. Blood and gore from warm-bodied creatures are among the few sources of warmth winter fey willingly touch, and they often display a prize of their most recent murderous delight-usually a body part of one of their victims-until a new target is marked for death." compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="tmuWWGifte" name="Gifted" description="From sire and dam to cub, each generation of wolves passes on the tale of the Pact to the next. No two packs tell the tale quite the same, but each telling speaks of a great white wolf, eyes red as coals, meeting the pack and challenging its leadership. This mythical wolf was none other than Baba Yaga in wolf form. Coming to the winter wolves, she ripped the pack leader&apos;s champion to shreds, then forced the leader to submit and bare its throat. Though the pack was hers to rule by right, she declined leadership and instead offered them a pact. She came to the winter wolves to recruit their aid in the Winter War, and promised them their own place in her nation once it was won. After Irrisen was hers, the wolves would travel to a human city known as Whitethrone. Here they would be honored beyond all save the blood of the queens of Irrisen. They would guard Whitethrone from enemies both inside and out, and rip the flesh from any who tried to escape the city walls. A hole would be rent in the city&apos;s mighty walls, that no gate might stand between the pack and the glory of the hunt. For their loyalty, they would be granted a boon-within their district in Whitethrone, dubbed the Howlings, the wolves would have the power to take the form of a human, enjoying all the pleasures that might bring.\n\nIn human form, wolves in both Redtooth and Whitethrone favor loose clothing that they can quickly don when changing into human form, and just as quickly remove or shake off when changing back into wolf form. When visiting winter wolves enter one of these areas, they feel the tingle of old magic and immediately are aware of their ability to shift. Wild winter wolves often feel animosity toward the city-dwelling wolves, but they jealously yearn to walk on two legs and feel the creature comforts of humanity. The pact has endured since the age of Whitethrone&apos;s founding, a testament to both the winter wolves&apos; unparalleled freedom within the city and the seduction of human form.\n\nThis tenacious effect is difficult to hinder. The ability to change shape does not function in an antimagic field, and any wolves entering an antimagic field in human form instantly revert to their true form. Permanently unraveling this effect requires powerful magic. A mage&apos;s disjunction spell has the potential remove it, but the effect is treated as if it were an artifact.

  <thing id="ruAzgenzak" name="Azgenzak" description="Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically “sacks of burning eyes,” are shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence. They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago. However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh over 800 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAzgenzaks are amorphous, their bodies composed of a flaccid, leathery outer skin enveloping an interior of glistening, wrinkled tissue, which in turn surrounds hundreds of cilia-rimmed sockets that weep flammable mucus. An azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inflates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water&apos;s surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak&apos;s interior and are snuffed out.\n\nAzgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they&apos;re able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion.\n\nAzgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak&apos;s stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAzgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slowmoving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature.\n\nAzgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o&apos;-wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the “bag” of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights.\n\nIn truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o&apos;-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o&apos;-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak&apos;s ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o&apos;-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o&apos;-wisp feeds psychically." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruDemAndra" name="Demon, Andrazku" description="Andrazkus are thugs who use their strength to lord over weaker creatures. Their hatred is cold and seething, prone to suddenly snapping in an avalanche of ice and crushing blows. Birthed from the protomatter of the Abyss with natural gifts for tracking and subduing prey, they are sometimes used as trackers and jailors by more powerful demons who need to find lost prisoners and slaves.\n\nFrom the waist up these demons are built much like strong, hairy humans or dwarves, but with exaggerated proportions resembling those of a gorilla. Their thick necks sport bristling manes that merge with the hair on their backs, and their flat faces bear two ramlike horns and cold eyes filled with hate. Their breath is a freezing fog, and their teeth are small but numerous, like a shark&apos;s. An andrazku&apos;s legs seem small in comparison to its torso, bend backward like a satyr&apos;s, and end in large cloven hooves. Their skin is the dead blue of a frozen corpse or a frost giant. Their top-heavy builds mean they have difficulty standing upright and normally assume a hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all fours, like apes. An andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 450 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAn andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who hated women and used his or her power to oppress and demean them, such as a tyrant who selectively enforced laws against women, a priest who preached that women are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his wives and daughters for their supposed failures. For this reason andrazkus are known to scholars as “misogyny demons.” Few of these souls dared to greater crimes (which would cause their souls to become incubi or babaus), nor were they once mortals who hated women but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku only forms from a soul filled with sufficient hatred toward women to provoke action, but that is hampered by enough cowardice to prevent it from performing acts of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but an especially misogynistic evil female creature might become an andrazku in the Abyss.\n\nAn andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey&apos;s fear, but becomes frustrated if the hunt lasts for too long. Despite these demons&apos; masculine appearance and aggression, most of them are impotent and some completely lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless. Their nature is to berate, degrade, and beat; they tend to kill only when they feel an urge to eat, when their stymied passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are mocked for their shortcomings.\n\nAn andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists (often contemptuously slapping foes, minions, and prey with an open hand), but a vicious one may use a scourge and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor. Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase down their prey, batter it for a while, and then release it, giving it enough of a head start that it thinks it has a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down (using locate creature and teleport) to repeat the cycle again.\n\nAn andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark its minions and slaves with a scar on one side of the face indicating the demon&apos;s ownership. The demon typically uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it is cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is resistant or immune to cold, the demon uses a knife to carve its mark into one side of the creature&apos;s face.\n\nBecause of their long-simmering tempers and magical abilities, andrazkus are often called “cold demons,” and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms such as Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their intolerance of fire (despite their demonic resistance to it) and the cowardly nature of their origin-sin make them laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus and incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and prone to take out their frustrations on weaker creatures-especially if said creatures are female.\n\nAndrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out of hard-packed snow. Some take advantage of their cold immunity and strong swimming ability to live in simple shelters on ice floes. An andrazku&apos;s hooves and huge hands allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough stone, preventing it from slipping and allowing it to use much of the vertical space in its lair to store treasure and observe intruders.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Soceity{/b}\nAndrazkus loathe associating with more powerful female demons in any way, and curse under their breath at mariliths and similar demons of great stature. Among female demons of similar power, they are quick with clever words, believable boasts, and secret confessions of desire, but these are all lies to disguise the hatred crackling beneath the surface. If given the opportunity, an andrazku would capture and torture a succubus merely because she is female (though a succubus is physically more powerful than a lone misogyny demon, and the hairy brutes have to gang up to have any chance of defeating a “weakling” succubus). Succubi and mariliths are aware of these simple-minded feelings held by andrazkus and they delight in tormenting the brutish creatures. Those female demons know they hold greater strength and power than andrazkus, and they enjoy lording over the creatures, even going so far as to kidnap them from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs and forcing the creatures into servitude.\n\nAndrazkus band together for strength, using their telepathy to silently coordinate their attacks. They often taunt their prey telepathically, either with words, promises of violence, or mocking laughter.\n\nWhen set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku usually forces itself into a position of power over a humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant tribes, especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones find better company among girallons and dire apes.\n\n{b}Summoning Andrazku{/b}\nAndrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and strength. They like offers of weapons and strengthenhancing items as payment for their services. They can be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku to undertake a mission other than these kinds of tasks takes a –2 penalty. A female summoner has a –10 penalty on all Charisma checks made to bargain unless the caster acts inferior and unworthy of the demon&apos;s aid." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruKokogiak" name="Kokogiak" description="The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of the kokogiak&apos;s dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nKokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids, and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique-they lie in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe, snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast. Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire nests in a single flick of the tongue.\n\nWhile they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks, kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water&apos;s edge serve them well in the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches. Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then, calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid dens.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nKokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer climes&apos; abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a kokogiak&apos;s mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community, chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the kokogiak&apos;s hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community.\n\nKokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power. More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the kokogiak&apos;s waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or more grisly trophies torn from its victims&apos; remains, artfully displayed for the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind them of the price of defiance.\n\nKokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals. Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival, struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving parent as its own mate." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruSangoi" name="Sangoi" description="Sangois are malevolent nocturnal fey that haunt small towns and graveyards. Because of their taste for blood and their similar habits, they are sometimes mistaken for vampires. Sangoi appear as short, emaciated humanoids seldom over 4 feet tall and weighing 35 to 40 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSangois thirst for the blood of the living, preferring humanoid blood, but settling for animal blood when humanoids are in short supply or when they are operating in disguise and do not wish to reveal their presence with an open attack. Though it is much harder to acquire, they are especially fond of the blood of good-aligned magical beasts, unicorns in particular. While blood provides physical nourishment for them, they also draw psychic sustenance from inflicting anguish and despair.\n\nSangois are expert trappers, catching large and small animals with magic or mundane snares. Trapped beasts might be mutilated for a sangoi&apos;s pleasure, though the wicked fey more likely dominates them and uses them to commit murder and mischief.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSangois are natives of the fey realms of the First World, but they spend little time there. Most of their time is spent roaming the Material Plane, lurking in shadows and places where death and sorrow linger, such as graveyards and ruins. They are wanderers, moving from village to village in search of their next victims. When a target is located, a sangoi (or, rarely, a pair of sangois working together) seeks to isolate the victim in order to murder it and take its form. The sangoi poses as its victim, while draining the emotional, mental, and physical energy out of those that give them succor with its curse of misery.\n\nSangoi consider themselves hunters of a sort, seeking children born with certain unique characteristics or deformities, such as those born covered with a caul, or who bear a particular birthmark or hair or eye color. Sangois fear those with such marks, whatever they might be, believing they render them powerless against such creatures and that if those with the marks are able to grow to maturity, they will bring ruin to the sangoi. Each individual sangoi has its own particular mark it grows to fear.\n\nChildren so marked are spirited away from their mortal parents and slain, sold as slaves to an evil fey master, or simply imprisoned in the depths of a sangoi&apos;s lair, all to quell whatever threat the sangois believe they pose.\n\nWhen such a child is found, a sangoi begins lurking about the home in the guise of an animal and might even take the form of a pet to attract the child&apos;s affection. Its curse falls upon the household with this infiltration, though sangois credit their chosen targets with immunity to their powers, or even the ability to block their powers from affecting others. Sangois attempt to abduct their targets at birth when possible, but often they do not discover them until a target is older. In such cases, sangois try to kill or kidnap their targets using dominated wild animals or traps set up to look like natural accidents.\n\nOnce a victim has been taken, a sangoi changes its shape to assume the victim&apos;s form, usually spending several days reading the victim&apos;s thoughts or speaking with its corpse to learn about it so it might better impersonate him. The sangoi then returns to the victim&apos;s home and assumes its life, going about his daily business while keeping out of direct sunlight when possible, often feigning illness or injury.\n\nOnce the sangoi enters its victim&apos;s home, its curse of misery begins to take hold, sapping the life and spirit from the family and friends of its victim. The sangoi amuses itself with the abuse and murder of domestic animals through traps and magical compulsion, and calls foul weather to cast a pall upon the house while it waits for the family of its victim to slip into ennui. Once those in the house fall into utter despair, the sangoi plans elaborate murders in which it renders its targets helpless, often with traps using common household objects and implements, and then carves out and greedily devours the hearts of its helpless victims, savoring the sour tang of fear that lingers in broken hearts even after death." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruSvathuri" name="Svathurim" description="Ancient tales claim the first svathurims spawned from Thremyr, akin to the creation stories of frost giants, ice trolls, winter wolves, and other creatures of snow and ice. The stories claim that when Thremyr fell into the Steaming Sea, he shed great icebergs that transformed into smaller copies of the god himself. The frost giants, spawned from his shedding body, worship this slumbering god as their creator, and thus consider svathurims their kin. The hindquarters of an adult svathurim are up to 10 feet tall and 16 feet long, while their giant trunk and head reach up to 18 feet on average. Svathurims typically weigh over 5 tons and may live up to 500 years, far longer than their frost giant kin.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSvathurims dwell deep in the frozen wastes of the tundra and arctic regions of Golarion, amid the great glaciers covering the Crown of the World. They occasionally travel along the frozen shores of polar seas, hunting seals, walruses, and whales that venture too close to shore or dragging vast nets through subarctic shallows during salmon runs. It is uncommon for svathurims to live in the vast boreal forests of the north, where their great bulk impedes movement among the trees, though some clans do dwell in the high mountains, springing from peak to peak in prodigious leaps and using their supernatural skyborne gallops.\n\nSvathurims are omnivorous and always hungry, able to subsist on scrub plants and kelp in times of great need, or even to eke out bare subsistence on the algae and lichen embedded in ice and rocks. However, they greatly prefer fresh, uncooked meat, and will devour every scrap of whatever they kill. Their grinding teeth are capable of reducing bone to meal, so even the toughest of a victim&apos;s remains generally end up in a svathurim&apos;s gullet. In the cold and pitiless environment of the north, nothing can be wasted.\n\nSvathurim males outnumber females by a wide margin, and these creatures are indiscriminate in their mating habits. The rare svathurim mares are little more selective in their affections than the males, and there is no shortage of males willing to court them. Ironically, many adult male svathurim are killed or wounded in competition for the attentions of females, either maimed and driven off by more dominant males or slain and presented as a trophy to prove worthiness to a female. Female svathurim are never monogamous, though, as mating with many males confuses the issue of parentage enough to keep their offspring safe from the predations of many adult males, lest a male inadvertently eradicate a foal svathurim that may be his own flesh and blood.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSvathurims live in clans, typically headed by the strongest and most accomplished hunter in the group, whether male or female. In some clans, svathurims gain status by the number of offspring they produce, though parentage is diff icult to prove for males and leads to frequent disputes.\n\nWhere females are both strong and fertile, they are able to assert dominance both by their own strength and by the loyalty and support of those children willing to fight for them. Of course, no svathurim can feel too secure in his position, as once-loyal supporters may shift their allegiance on a whim, and even faithful children may decide that they have grown strong enough to betray their parent to a rival or gather support (often from siblings) to take power in their own right.\n\nSvathurims sometimes build large corrals of stone, ice, or rarely bone or wood where such materials are available in plenty. Usually unroofed, these monolithic barriers serve mostly to keep predators away from their young or to protect their stores of treasure or food gathered by the clan from raiders. A rare few svathurims build more secure enclosed lodges or delve permanent hostels in caves. Svathurims that choose to settle in one area are most likely to live among frost giants.\n\nFrost giants view svathurims with a mix of fear, respect, awe, and revulsion. Most know well the tale of the svathurims&apos; creation, and while not all take this as evidence of pseudo-divinity and a shared creation myth, few deny the svathurims&apos; speed, strength, and skill at hunting and killing. For some giant clans, satisfying a svathurim&apos;s whims is a small price to pay for the advantages gained by an alliance with them.\n\nSvathurims collect treasure as frost giants do, favoring precious metals in raw nuggets that are then hammered into crude tribal jewelry. Bracelets, armlets, and rings and chains they can braid into their hair, beards, and long horse-like tails are favored treasures, as are inlays and carvings made of mammoth or walrus ivory. Those in subarctic regions collect amber and rare boreal hardwoods, polishing the latter to a luxurious shine and engraving them with runic inscriptions and genealogies both real and imagined." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruStormgho" name="Stormghost" description="Bestial hunters that prowl the mountains of Triaxus, stormghosts are a deadly threat to all creatures that stumble across their path. Triaxians attributed the name stormghost to these creatures because of their ability to conjure malignant weather and attack unseen. Stormghosts typically attack in remote mountainous areas, leaping down on their victims from cliff sides and ambushing them in blind mountain passes. Constantly in search of food, stormghosts are excellent hunters and trackers. These predators are completely unafraid of engaging with any target, and thus pose a risk to the humanoids of the planet-and even the dragons. As with Triaxians, stormghosts&apos; appearances vary depending on the season. Thankfully, stormghosts are extremely rare, but the creatures live exceedingly long lives. A stormghost&apos;s regeneration diminishes long-term degradation of its body, allowing it to live for over 2,000 years. A stormghost stands nearly 8 feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend its legs to reach up to 14 feet. Formed of muscled flesh and hardened chitin, a stormghost weighs roughly 1,500 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nStormghosts are apex predators in Triaxus&apos;s hills and mountains; a few even make their way to the lowlands. A stormghost is ephemeral like a phantom, and its coloration and ability to become invisible give rise to part of its common name, as victims are typically unaware of the creature&apos;s presence until it is far too late. It can also call down storms and banks of fog-the source of the other part of its common name-and can even conjure darkness. Stormghosts themselves, however, can see through fog and darkness, and possess other specialized senses. While the creatures have no recognizable nose, they are capable of tracking their prey by scent using a specialized sensory organ found on the lower part of their torsos. This organ picks up faint chemical signatures with such accuracy that a stormghost can differentiate between two creatures of the same type and recall with perfect detail an individual creature&apos;s signature for years after first encountering it.\n\nAs with all successful hunters, stormghosts&apos; senses and tenacity make them difficult to evade. These traits, in addition to their superior stamina, help stormghosts doggedly hunt down prey that initially escapes their clutches. Exceptionally single-minded, stormghosts live to hunt and hate losing their quarry, and they persistently pursue their fleeing prey, foregoing sleep and ignoring other victims that might be easier to take down-even if they&apos;re ravenous-in order to make their desired kill.\n\nStormghosts undergo a change during Triaxus&apos;s transitional seasons, shifting their coloration to match their environment. In the winter, stormghosts have an icy white hide that allows them to better conceal themselves in the snow. As summer comes and the planet begins to thaw, stormghosts&apos; hides darken and a splotched coloration of grays and browns emerges. This coloration allows them to hide themselves in the mountainous terrain in which they live.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nStormghosts are solitary creatures that despise sharing their hunting grounds with other creatures, especially other stormghosts. When another predator begins hunting in the same region as a stormghost, the stormghost shifts its predation to that creature, tracking it down and consuming it. The exception to this is when another stormghost trespasses upon its hunting grounds. While the stormghost still tracks down and kills its competition as it would another creature, it does not consume the rival stormghost, finding the flesh of its own kind completely unpalatable, and instead ritualistically butchers its competitor and leaves the corpse as a sign that this territory is already claimed.\n\nStormghosts are exceedingly rare; fewer than 1,000 have been spotted, according to records kept by dragonriders of the Skyfire Mandate. Many of these sightings, made safely from the back of a dragonkin, are believed to be of the same stormghost, leading many scholars to estimate that the population might be much smaller, with a few at most living in the Parapet Mountains. A naturalist in Preita recently published a journal detailing his journey in search for evidence of a stormghost, as tales of these and other vicious beasts are fashionable in the cosmopolitan cities of the Allied Territories. In this journal, he postulates that stormghosts are aliens from another world in the solar system, or perhaps beyond. Their long lives, regenerative capabilities, robust physical form, yet low population numbers suggest this hypothesis is plausible.\n\nAlthough this researcher clearly lacks a greater understanding of worlds beyond Triaxus, his findings on the otherworldly origins of stormghosts are indeed quite accurate. On a planet in a nearby solar system, stormghosts were grown in facilities to be biological probes deployed on specific planets for 2,000 years before they would be retrieved. During their time on those worlds, they are tasked, compelled by their very genesis and the urge of every cell, to kill and consume organic life. Over the course of their lives, a gland within their torsos at the base of the neck collects samples of every kill. These samples can be collected by the stormghost&apos;s creators and analyzed. What they are searching for is anyone&apos;s guess, but the number of stormghosts on Triaxus suggests these unknown creators seek a comprehensive collection of dragons and dragonkind." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruUrsikka" name="Ursikka" description="Like enormous, nightmarish praying mantises, ursikkas roam the Triaxian wilderness during the wandering planet&apos;s winter years. These vicious, short-tempered predators rule primeval environs by default, being among Triaxus&apos;s largest, hungriest beasts. Ursikkas&apos; towering height, which can reach 25 feet, is mostly due to the long, slender walking legs on which the creatures skitter with an eerie speed that belies their hulking size. A long, bloated abdomen accounts for most of the beasts&apos; 20 feet oflength. Ursikkas&apos; thoraxes anchor their grasping forearms, which each end in sharp pincers capable of shearing flesh from bone like hot knives cutting through butter.\n\nUrsikkas&apos; white, shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies, and their three-part maws can open wide enough to swallow a human whole. The freezing, sticky fluid that drips from their gnashing jaws aids this activity even further.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nUrsikkas are specifically suited to their home planet&apos;s long winter season. Their impossibly cold bodily fluids, which allow them to thrive in subzero temperatures, grant them equally cold saliva that helps the beasts kill their prey as well as digest it. Further, the property that keeps ursikkas&apos; spittle liquid at its freezing temperature also makes it incredibly sticky-a quality that aids the creatures in combat and when preparing for Triaxus&apos;s hot summer years.\n\nDuring their planet&apos;s long winter, ursikkas terrorize Triaxus&apos;s large swaths of uncivilized land in endless quests for food. The ravenous creatures require several tons of raw meat each week to survive. Although they prefer to eat the flesh oflarge, cold-blooded creatures, hungry ursikkas pursue any viable prey, particularly victims that seem sluggish and easy to catch. When the end of winter approaches, the huge quantity of food they consume fuels an increased production of saliva, which they use to prepare their summer abodes.\n\nDuring Triaxus&apos;s summers, ursikkas live inside cocoons constructed from their own saliva. In the weeks before the change of seasons, ursikkas choose an inconspicuous locale-such as inside cave complexes or even holes of their own construction-in which to spend the long summer. The creatures then tirelessly weave their spittle around their bodies until they&apos;re fully covered. In 24 hours, the chemicals in the spittle harden it into an impenetrable sheath that protects ursikkas from Triaxus&apos;s brutal summer heat. Shortly after their spittle-cocoons harden, the beasts go dormant and do not awake until the temperature returns to a more tolerable level.\n\nAlthough ursikkas are known for aggressiveness during the entirety of winter, they are at their most volatile right before and right after dormancy. An ursikka that is interrupted while weaving its cocoon immediately attempts to kill the intruders. An ursikka whose cocoon is broken during the summer emerges similarly enraged; ursikkas that defeat the creatures responsible for waking them attempt to reconstruct their cocoons, but as spittle production ceases during hibernation, those efforts often fail. Some Summerborn Triaxians actively seek out the cocoons of slumbering ursikkas, knowing they can defeat the exposed beasts relatively easily.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWith their ruthless predatory skills and voracious appetites, ursikkas typically live solitary existences. However, in places where prey is abundant-such as the wilds of the Drakelands and in the Allied Territories-ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives of three to 10. In such cases, ursikkas still hunt alone. Triaxian scholars note that the creatures don&apos;t hesitate to kill each other should one steal another&apos;s meal.\n\nIn accordance with their long life cycles, ursikkas mate infrequently. Once or twice each winter, the larger females of the species typically seek out mates as determinedly as they hunt prey. Afterward, each female lays one enormous, fertilized egg made of a secretion similar to the creatures&apos; hardened saliva. After a 5-year gestation period, the egg hatches. If ursikka parents are even aware of their offspring, though, their behavior does not indicate it.\n\nAccording to scholars, young ursikkas grow to maturity in fewer than 10 years. One disturbing speculation indicates that adult ursikkas sometimes enjoy the flesh of their younger counterparts-and may actually hunt juvenile members of their own species if prey becomes scarce. Whether this behavior is simply a way for adult ursikkas to survive or a warped way for them to retain their territorial dominance is unknown.\n\nAlthough they are very long-lived, ursikkas rarely live through more than two Triaxian winters. In the planet&apos;s most isolated territories, where few predators or stalwart hunters threaten them, ursikkas typically die of old age during their dormant period; ursikka carcasses swathed in shimmering, deteriorating cocoons are not uncommon in these frontiers. In more populated areas, ursikkas&apos; lifespans are shorter, especially given the hardy, cold-forged winter cultures that hunt the creatures for protection, thrills, and sometimes meat. Indeed, the warriors of the most populous nations of the Allied Territories consider a slain ursikkas&apos; claws, mandibles, and bulbous eyes the ultimate hunting trophies. Some even make furred armor from ursikkas&apos; durable exoskeletons." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruWolliped" name="Wolliped" description="Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds weren&apos;t domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nWollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus.\n\nWalking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts&apos; facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills.\n\nWhile other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked, while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of design options.\n\nLike Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats. Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why.\n\nIn addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays.\n\nWollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense. Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders.\n\nThe dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus&apos;s dragon population, though most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter years." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruWoliComb" name="Wolliped (Combat Trained)" description="Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds weren&apos;t domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nWollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus.\n\nWalking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts&apos; facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills.\n\nWhile other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked, while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of design options.\n\nLike Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats. Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why.\n\nIn addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays.\n\nWollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense. Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders.\n\nThe dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus&apos;s dragon population, though most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter years." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruAnimTank" name="Animated Tank" description="The brains of great military commanders and tacticians need not go to waste simply because their mortal bodies have been slain. Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside.\n\nAnimated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.\n\nAnimated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank&apos;s unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander&apos;s orders without regard to the tank&apos;s missing crew. Those hearing the tanks&apos; orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers.\n\nAnimated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav&apos;s mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nAn animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than crafting the construct&apos;s tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank&apos;s creation requirements-beyond the body of an intact tank-an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in the chaos of war on Earth.\n\n{b}CL{/b} 12th; {/b}Price{/b} 200,000 gp\n{b}Requirements{/b} Craft Construct, {i}animate object, geas/quest, resurrection, telekinesis{/i}; {b}Skill{/b} Craft (blacksmithing), Knowledge (engineering), and Heal DC 25; {b}Cost{/b} 100,000 gp" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruDaemGent" name="Daemon, Genthodaemon" description="Genthodaemons are common troops of daemonic armies, resolutely obedient to any greater type of daemon that gives them orders. They personify death in hopeless or futile wars, genocide, and the despair created by long, bloody stalemates where the combatants lose their will to live and forget why they were fighting in the first place. They have almost no role in corrupting mortals, as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to summon a genthodaemon.\n\nA genthodaemon looks like a stereotypical fiend-basically humanoid, but with claws, a tail, batlike wings, and cloven hooves. Metal armored plates, barbs, and spikes cover its body, though these are part of the daemon rather than armor it wears. Its claws are jagged metal shards sprouting from its fingers where nails should be.\n\nGenthodaemons are only slightly above cacodaemons and lacridaemons in the hierarchy of Abaddon. A greater daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn&apos;t interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons.\n\nA typical genthodaemon stands over 9 feet tall and weighs 500 to 600 pounds (with much of this weight stemming from the daemon&apos;s embedded metal).\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSouls that become genthodaemons usually come from worlds where war technology has advanced to allow production of large amounts of metal armor and weapons-particularly worlds where firearms have been invented. When battle grows so such a scope that the enemy becomes a faceless tide, or killing becomes casual and easy at long range, the act of waging war becomes completely dehumanized and soldiers become mere pieces in a perpetual machine. In such grim instances and the seeds are planted to send soldiers&apos; souls to Abaddon.\n\nThese ties to the craft of war stain the dead soul and the daemon created from it, manifesting as armor plates fused with daemonic flesh, pieces of weapons embedded in its bones, or even remnants of siege engines or barbed wire sprouting from or wrapped around the daemon&apos;s body. These elements are part of the daemon, not mere decorations, but any mechanical pieces merely resemble functional items and no longer work (for example, a daemon with a crossbow or rifle embedded in its arm cannot shoot it). Genthodaemons from the same band often resemble each other, including the shape of their metal parts, sometimes because their mortal selves were even in the same army and uniform.\n\nThough genthodaemons serve in the armies of all four Horsemen, they are most strongly associated with Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Her military background, strong discipline, and focus on the brutality of war resonates with the core of a genthodaemon&apos;s being. Those who (as mortals) were involved in acts of genocide have a morbid fascination with obscisidaemons and tend to follow them. Though genthodaemons were not the instigators of genocide in their mortal lives (which could have granted them higher status on Abaddon), those who participated in such acts feel a fawning admiration for the greater daemons who orchestrated such atrocities.\n\nLike other daemons, genthodaemons hate all living things-and to an extent, themselves-and look forward to the death of the last mortal, for on that day they will have no other reminders of their bleak mortal lives and can focus all their hate inward.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nGenthodaemons patrol the fortresses, cities, ruins, and wastelands of Abaddon looking for invaders, hostile non-daemons, and gangs of the hunted. Because they usually travel in groups, they are rarely preyed upon by other creatures and only have to face death when deployed as part of a Horseman&apos;s army. They are of low status but fulfill a necessary role as soldiers of Abaddon. Greater daemons treat them with the formal respect due their relative difference in rank, much like how a general might treat a common soldier. However, in the wars against mortal life, the Horsemen understand the value of suicidal missions and brazen sacrifice, and are not above sending countless genthodaemons to permanent destruction if it advances the cause of Abaddon. The genthodaemons accept this as their lot and never complain, as protests require effort, will, and the belief that there is a possibility of change-three things these shell-shocked creatures lost long ago.\n\nOn the Material Plane, genthodaemons sometimes serve daemonic cults that are unworthy of a greater daemon&apos;s attention or lacking the power to summon a more powerful creature. As their magic is suitable for war and destruction, they have limited use to mortal cultists not intent on violence." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruFext" name="Fext" description="Any good general forbids mention of fexts among his ranks, but such strictures do little to prevent soldiers from whispering tales of undying officers leading enemy units. These supernatural officers-often the targets of dozens of strikes and attempted assassinations over the course of their careers-never seem to fall to these attempts, and when they do, they return for the next clash unfazed. Soldiers whisper that these undead officers are only vulnerable to glass arrows, glass bullets, or glass daggers. Tales of fexts, usually dismissed as camp folktales derived from soldiers&apos; frustration at failed campaigns and lost battles, are most frighteningly true-a truth living officers keep from the normal rank and file, for it takes a truly strong leader to send his soldiers against an unkillable foe.\n\nFexts are relatively new on the face of Golarion. The Whispering Way is said to be behind the existence of these powerful creatures, which not only possess skills at warfare and widespread destruction, but also excel at the subterfuge and guile necessary to pass themselves off as normal, living humanoids. While these abominations often serve corrupt monarchs or power-hungry and desperate tyrants, some fexts infiltrate good armies and act as horrible warlords, defying their nation&apos;s ideals. These fexts use politics and miscommunication to distort the truth of their battlefield atrocities.\n\nThough a fext normally acts as a commander on the battlefield, when engaged in combat, a fext favors its martial prowess, intermingling quick strikes and deadly blows with disruptive curses and its energy drain ability. Many fexts enjoy cruel and humiliating alternatives for their curses instead of simply reducing ability scores or the effectiveness of attack rolls-they may choose abstract effects such as having the target&apos;s commander view him as an enemy or making the target of the curse appear loathsome to fellow soldiers in order to break ranks. In war zones, fexts never spare a kill, being eager to use their death knell spell-like ability. Also, as they wade through scorched battlefields, they frequently use their speak with dead spell-like ability to discern information about rival armies.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nStrange rituals doom a child to becoming a fext, ensuring its twisted immortality. Usually male and usually human, the child is destined from birth to die young, but will shine in undeath as a great military leader. Wicked rites corrupt the child while it&apos;s still in its mother&apos;s womb, infusing it with a power that burns brightly during its development, only to dim upon reaching adulthood into a spiral of blackness followed by an immediate descent into undeath.\n\nCreating a fext requires a caster of at least 15th level who must subject an expectant mother to weekly treatments throughout her pregnancy, consisting of an array of charms, herbs, oils, pastes, and powders. After the child is born, a portion of the preserved placenta must be carried or kept near the fext throughout its childhood, usually disguised as a charm, stuffed into a doll, or worked into a favored toy or memento. Born a strong and healthy child, the fext leads a mostly typical life for a child of its parentage, region, and status, maintaining a keen intellect and hearty physique. These boons in its youth all but guarantee it a powerful place in society, especially in the field of battle. A young fext finds itself enamored with warfare of any kind and usually studies weaponry, fighting styles, and historical battles with a voracious appetite. Some fexts grow up knowing their destiny-or learn of it along the way-and choose to dedicate their lives to preparing for some dark purpose. Upon reaching adulthood, a fext falls ill. With fever rising and a head full of hallucinations, the fext lies comatose for a week. During this time, the creature slowly passes from mortality, its soul hanging suspended between worlds, then crumbling into undeath. The transition from life to undeath yields great benefits to a fext, though some experience shocking revelations during the transformation.\n\nLike vampires, fexts decay at a slower rate than most undead, allowing the creatures to feign normal life for at least a decade. During this time, their skin slowly grows pallid and the odor of death increasingly haunts them. As fexts begin to degrade, the creatures employ mundane disguises and use restorative spells to maintain their physical bodies&apos; previous appearance.\n\nMaintaining their image, fexts generally keep to their expected behavior and use their given names until disguise becomes too difficult. At that point, they often choose a name from the Necril tongue, granted in a vision during their transformation to undeath.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFexts have no choice as to where they grow up, but in adolescence and young adulthood, before the transformation takes place, they find themselves drawn to areas of conflict and war. In fact, regions of political turmoil and constant battles are breeding grounds for fexts-the ritual that creates these creatures is performed almost exclusively in war-torn countries for two reasons. First, it ensures the youth grows up knowing the ravages of war, allowing the fext to learn the reality of death early on, just as a child in a more idyllic setting might learn to play make-believe. Second, it places the youth in a position to become a great leader and a strong warrior who strives to lead forces in battle.\n\nThe ritual for creating a fext is nearly as variable as the path to lichdom, and must be customized for each potential child who is to carry the honor. Some parents are aware of the path their unborn child is destined to walk, but others are manipulated into allowing these foul rites. They remain unaware of what the procedure will do to their child, and being told it will protect the child and make it stronger. Subjects for this transformation are usually children of nobles or families renowned for a lineage of strong soldiers. When those driven to create a fext discover an ideal mother is with child, they pose as midwives or doctors, and work the rites into their regular care, explaining the tinctures and herbs away as beneficial supplements for the mother and child." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruTrenchMi" name="Trench Mist" description="Trench mists are created anywhere that deadly gas attacks are used for the wholesale slaughter of troops, whether attacks of a mundane poisonous nature, or from the magical effects of spells such as acid fog. Under mysterious circumstances likely born of the horrors of war and the final throes of young soldiers dying before their time, these mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing souls of the slain. This commingling of loosed life energy and strange chemicals grants the miasma a sly, malevolent sentience. Once so born, the trench mist then seeks only to impart misery and share its singular fate with those fortunate enough to have escaped the poisonous attacks that birthed the creature in the first place. As it preys upon the living it absorbs the afflicted into its growing horde of shambling servants. Victims of its acidic mist rise as hateful zombies under the creature&apos;s control, and a trench mist that gains a horde of zombies is a dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields where trench mists are known to have arisen, wise commanders arrange cease-fires during which both sides abandon the site, lest their troops succumb to the horrifying fate of their comrades.\n\nPart of the trench mist&apos;s self-awareness comes from the symbiotic trench zombies it gains as it slaughters its victims, as the zombies under the mist&apos;s control retain the abilities they had in life as well as some snippets of their former memories, which all feed into the collective consciousness of the trench mist. This allows the mist to learn and adapt, granting it a relatively keen intelligence compared to other similar creatures, and allowing it to make canny combat decisions and cleverly manipulate its surroundings.\n\nTrench mists wander battlefields looking for prey so they can add more shambling zombies to their collective hordes. Occasionally they might even enter inhabited areas to seek out fresh ammunition and armaments for those of their symbiotic undead who may have exhausted their weaponry. When bereft of such foul company, trench mists often persist for years after the tides of war have receded, settling into the soil and slumbering until fresh prey arises. The lifespan of trench mists is unknown, though through this sort of hibernation they very well may be immortal, reemerging without warning at the scenes of ancient battles centuries after they have taken place, whether turned up by an unsuspecting farmer&apos;s plow or war waged anew." compset="Race">

Ostensibly, the deposed daughter joins her mother in the Dancing Hut and goes on to bigger and better things far beyond the bounds of Irrisen and Golarion, but the true fate of the queens of Irrisen remains a mystery to most. In fact, these former queens never leave the confines of the Dancing Hut-drained of their vitality and power by Baba Yaga and imprisoned deep inside the hut&apos;s innermost chambers, these daughters become crone queens, undead mockeries of the powerful witches they once were.\n\nThe crone queens are unique creatures, each one a former queen of Irrisen. They are bound to the Hall of Thrones inside the Dancing Hut, where Baba Yaga has erected a throne for each deposed queen. Currently there are only 12 crone queens, though the Hall of Thrones holds 14 royal seats. One throne sits ready for the current queen, Elvanna, when her reign is over, and the other is left empty-the throne of Tashanna, Baba Yaga&apos;s ninth daughter and the only queen to escape the fate shared by her sisters.\n\nAs a crone queen ages, the long years take their toll on the necromantic energies animating the unliving husk of her body, and movement and activity become more difficult. Although their powers have not diminished with age, the oldest crone queens rarely leave their frozen thrones; less interested in vengeance, they instead spend the long centuries reliving the memories of their former lives. It takes a significant effort to rouse them from their dreamlike reveries, but once awakened, the eldest crone queens are dangerous foes indeed." compset="Race">

With their ability to blend in with their surroundings and climb nearly any surface, these creatures patrol the hag&apos;s lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side of their creator&apos;s personality, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures pursue their goal mindlessly until a countermand is given.\n\nHag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. To date, no specimens have been found weighing more than 500 pounds.\n\n{b}Creating a Hag Eye Ooze{/b}\nThe process of creating a hag eye ooze is a strange blend of cooking in a cauldron and the magic rituals involved in sparking simulated life into a construct.\n\nCreating a hag eye ooze requires 2 weeks. This time is reduced if the brewer is working cooperatively. For each additional member of a coven involved in the process, the creation time is lessened by 2 days, to a minimum creation period of 3 days. During this period, various nutrients and ingredients must be added to the cauldron in which the ooze is brewed. As the ingredients are added the hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary arcane energies to create the hag eye ooze do not properly bind to the creature&apos;s nascent form. If successful, she then begins a 24-hour ritual, during which the cauldron holding the brewing ooze is bombarded with spells. This ritual and spellcasting culminates in the addition of a hag eye-preferably from the hag creator. If the ritual is successful, the hag eye ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The hag eye ooze is under the control of the creator, but in cases where a coven takes part in creating the ooze, control goes to the hag that supplied the hag eye." compset="Race">

When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it.

  <thing id="ruPoludnic" name="Poludnica" description="Driven by an obsession that few can fully comprehend, poludnicas are bitter creatures of light, heat, and envy. Although they are surprisingly strong and deadly combatants, these scythe-wielding women resort to violence only when guile and trickery have failed. They are lonely creatures that seek the company of mortals by luring farm workers and children away from their families so that they can briefly enjoy a feeble simulation of family life. In the rural farming communities where her kind is most commonly found, a poludnica might also be known as Cornwife, Lady Midday, or Mother Noon. She might even be mistaken for a vengeful or beneficent ghost depending on how she presents herself.\n\nAveraging 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 170 pounds, poludnicas could easily be mistaken for strapping farm girls if it were not for their radiance. Their maximum life expectancy has not been documented and it is commonly believed that poludnicas are effectively immortal unless they suffer some deadly mishap. It has been theorized that permanently keeping a poludnica in magically darkened conditions would eventually lead to her death, but no scholars have so far attempted to prove this hypothesis.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nPoludnicas draw their physical sustenance from sunlight, but they often eat and drink to emulate the simple folk who are the subjects of their obsession. However, emotional nourishment is more difficult for them to obtain and their need for companionship and the simulation of a normal family life leads them to commit questionable acts of kidnapping or even murder.\n\nLike bees who pollinate nearby flowers-which then go to seed and produce more flowers the next season-a poludnica&apos;s ability to enrich local plant life leads farming communities to thrive around their lairs. These plentiful fields bring more farmhands and more families, all potential companions for the poludnica.\n\nThough the magic that pulls poludnicas into the Ethereal Plane at nightfall is viewed as a curse, it is also one of their most useful abilities. Though distressed and weakened on the Ethereal Plane, poludnicas can nonetheless perceive events upon the Material Plane. They often spend their nights spying on mortal families. Each night they move ethereally through mortals&apos; homes, watching them eat, sleep, and enjoy the company and intimacy of others. Though this fills all poludnicas with sorrow, many are also driven to impotent, jealous rage as they watch children sleeping peacefully and wives embracing their husbands.\n\nThe origin of their cursed existence is a mystery-whether poludnicas were created by some powerful creature that did not anticipate the maddening effects of their abilities or whether they were once different creatures cursed for some failure or insult is not known. Either way, the curse has driven these lonely fey slightly mad.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nPoludnicas usually claim a few hundred acres of fertile land as their territory, most often centered on a lair that is hidden in plain sight, inaccessible, or avoided by the community, such as a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a tree, the tumbledown barn of a former companion who no longer lives, or an abandoned and supposedly haunted farmhouse.\n\nBy day, a poludnica prowls crop fields seeking to lure, coerce, or physically abduct an overworked farmhand back to her home where she has built a mockery of a human farmhouse kitchen or bedroom, expecting her abductee to indulge her whims in a pantomime of normalcy, companionship, or intimacy. Sometimes one of these companions might choose to play along with his captor or try to escape during daylight hours, but those that bide their time until nightfall when the poludnica disappears at least have a chance of escape.\n\nIf a companion survives until nightfall, the poludnica fades away, leaving the suitor or child to fend for himself while she watches impotently from the Ethereal Plane. This may not prove to be a problem, but since many poludnicas make their daytime lairs in inaccessible places, if the captive cannot free himself before dawn, the poludnica often simply returns-likely unhappy with the “inconsiderate” companion&apos;s lack of loyalty to his new “family.”\n\nSome poludnicas who are kinder than most choose to hide their presence altogether. They avoid coming into contact with the peasants working the land, except at night where they can invisibly and sorrowfully observe mortals enjoying the companionship that is denied to the poludnicas themselves. More commonly, poludnicas are driven to lure away farmhands and kidnap children who they believe will come to love them and consider them their new family.\n\nFor all the suffering poludnicas cause, dwelling in a poludnica&apos;s territory is not without its benefits. Their crop-enriching powers provide abundant food, and many farming communities have come to see them as a kind of guardian spirit. Children often weave cornhusk dolls to placate a local poludnica, ask for her protection, or thank her for sparing their fathers or brothers. Some poludnicas are touched by these displays and stop, or at least reduce, their predations on those in the community." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruStormHag" name="Storm Hag" description="A storm hag resembles a shrunken old woman with a thundercloud of hair stacked atop her wrinkled head. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth; small arcs of electricity can be seen jumping across her teeth and spittle. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag&apos;s wrinkled face contains a look of gleeful distaste, and her eyes are thick with cataracts, rendering her gaze pupil-less. A storm hag&apos;s hair is wild and unruly with static electricity popping and crackling throughout the mass. Seemingly animated, a storm hag&apos;s hair can easily stand as tall as she is. Wiry and stooped, a storm hag weighs about 70 pounds and stands a little over 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet or more. A storm hag usually wears rough furs and coarse woolen clothing that is rarely cleaned, giving her a distinctly unpleasant odor.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLike most other living things, a storm hag needs to eat, and her favorite meal is the tender flesh of young children. Storm hags use their ability to smell children and young animals to track down their meals no matter where the child has hidden himself. On Golarion, storm hags have developed a special fondness for Kellid and Ulfen children.\n\nStorm hags find the childlike gnomes and halflings infuriating. It is unknown why this is so-perhaps storm hags cannot distinguish between children and members of these small races on sight and are angered that their prey is not actually their favorite food. They may very well just have some other unknown pet peeve about the smaller folk, but either way, the presence of gnomes or halflings drives storm hags into a rage. When given the choice, storm hags always target members of these races above all others.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nStorm hags are most numerous in the northern lands of the Inner Sea region, but with their ability to fly, their insatiable hunger, and the desire to share their hate with others, storm hags can likely appear anywhere. They prefer areas that are prone to inclement weather, and enjoy flying through the air during thunderstorms, feeling the static discharge dancing across their warty skin. Storm hags most frequently claim territory in the wild spaces between settlements where they keep their distance from civilization unless hunting. Like a predator, a storm hag constantly surveys her territory and takes great pains in keeping a secret den she considers always hers. For the most part, a storm hag is content to remain in one place if the food is plentiful and her shelter is safe and obscured. A storm hag&apos;s den is a simple, yet grotesque affair, often located in deep, dark forests or atop craggy mountains, and is always hidden from sight. Cluttered with bones and skins from previous meals, a den&apos;s most dominant feature is the storm hag&apos;s cauldron.\n\nStorm hags roam their territory hunting, preferring to prey on children if possible, but they do consider adult humanoids suitable substitutes when children are unavailable. A storm hag only stoops to eating animals when her hunger grows too strong, however.\n\nWhen a storm hag encounters travelers in her territory, she torments the unwitting visitors, calling down the winds and whipping up a storm of howling gales and crashing lightning to break her enemies&apos; ranks and to send them running for shelter. Once her prey has been cornered into a cave or thicket where they sought shelter from the weather, the storm hag sows discontent by using her whispering wind spell-like ability to harass and frighten the sheltered travelers with a hate-filled, disembodied voice. Like a cat toying with a crippled field mouse, the storm hag pushes her prey to their breaking point-letting them steep in shivering fright-before confronting them face to face with tooth, claw, and lightning before finally killing and consuming them.\n\n{b}Storm Hag Covens{/b}\nLike other hags, storm hags form covens. They prefer to form these covens with other storm hags, but storm hags have been known to team up with green hags or other hags on occasion. Storm hags inhabiting stormy coasts or soggy salt marshes sometimes ally with sea hags and form covens with them. Though they respect the strength of annis hags, few storm hags enter into a coven with those brutish and simple creatures. When they do, the storm hags rely on the annis hags&apos; intimidating physical might to help in their hunts.\n\nA storm hag is an attractive prospect for any burgeoning coven-to-be, but these hags aren&apos;t easily wooed into joining with others. A storm hag is haughty and views her way of doing something as the best, if only because she is the one doing it. Any hag thinking of forming a coven with a storm hag would do well to ride a fine line between flattery and outright dominance by performing simultaneous acts of humble depravity and honorific evil. The other two hags in a coven with a storm hag gain her child-scent ability as long as they are within 100 feet of the storm hag. In addition, a coven with a storm hag as a member has access to the following spell-like abilities beyond what a normal coven provides: call lightning storm (DC 18), plague storm (DC 19), quench (DC 16), whirlwind (DC 21), wind wall. Like other covens, all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another and must work together and take a full-round action take part in this cooperative magic." compset="Race">

This ability can only affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses her combat maneuver bonus as if tripping a creature normally. The {i}gust of wind{/i} spell doesn&apos;t possess its normal effects, but instead sweeps a creature off its feet. Attempting to trip a creature with this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability provokes attacks of opportunity as normal." compset="RaceSpec" summary="Gust of wind spell trips and blows foes off their feet.">
