The creature can use that ability as an aligned spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability normally usable only once or twice per day). An aligned spell-like ability gains the good, evil, lawful, or chaotic descriptor.\n\nWhen a creature uses an aligned spell-like ability, one-half the spell-like ability&apos;s damage is of that type (evil, good, lawful, or chaotic). For example, a creature casts an aligned (evil) lightning bolt with a caster level of 6th. The aligned lightning bolt deals 3d6 points of unholy damage and 3d6 points of electricity damage. Thus, a creature immune to electricity suffers no damage from the electricity effect, but still takes 3d6 points of unholy damage.\n\nAligned spell-like abilities deal normal damage to creatures with regeneration if the creature&apos;s description states that it takes damage from that type of effect (for instance, devils that are only harmed by goodaligned spells and effects would take damage from a good-aligned spell-like ability). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities that already have an alignment descriptor are not affected.\n\nThe creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level &#150;1. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 6th-level caster can only align spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 2nd level or lower.\n\n{b}Special:{/b} This feat can be taken multiple times.

(Damage includes physical damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain.) Breath weapons that cause petrification, slow, haste, or replicate any spell that cannot be quantified as damage (see above) do not gain the bonus for increased damage. For example, a gorgon&apos;s normal breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of petrifying gas. Using this feat, the same gorgon could release its breath in a line to a range of 120 feet. Since its breath weapon petrifies an opponent, it does not gain the 1-1/2 bonus to damage (as there really isn&apos;t any physical damage dealt).\n\nA line-shaped breath weapon can be released in a cone with a range of one-half its normal effect. The breath weapon deals half normal damage due to the effect being diluted over an area. For example, a behir&apos;s normal breath weapon is a 20-foot line that deals 7d6 points of electricity damage. Using this feat, it could release it in a 10-foot cone that dealt 3d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in the area.\n\nA breath weapon can be shaped as a burst with a range of 30 feet or the normal range for the creature&apos;s breath weapon if it was released in a line (whichever is smaller). The breath weapon travels to the range indicated or until it contacts a solid surface (whichever happens first). Upon impacting a solid surface or reaching maximum range, the breath weapon explodes in a burst from the point of origin and covers an area as if the creature had released its breath weapon in a cone. Affected creatures in the area take damage as if the creature had released its breath weapon in a cone. For example, a behir (normal breath weapon is a line, 20 feet long, 7d6 electricity damage) could release its breath weapon as a burst with a range of 20 feet. When the breath weapon contacts a solid surface or reaches a point 20 feet away, it explodes and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to all within 10 feet of the point of origin." compset="Feat" summary="Can release breath weapon as a cone, line, or burst." uniqueness="useronce">
