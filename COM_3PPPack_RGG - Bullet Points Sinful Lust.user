You must be dressed in a courtier&#146;s outfit, entertainer&#146;s outfit, noble&#146;s outfit, tear-away clothing, or nothing. You also cannot be wearing medium or heavy armor (unless it is magically enchanted to increase your appeal, such as alluring armor from Krazy Kragnar&#146;s Black Market Magic Items). As long as this is the case, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks against creatures with an Int of 3 or more. As a result of the confidence you feel being yourself, you also gain a +2 bonus to Initiative checks." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

For purposes of Diplomacy checks and enchantment spells, any effort to get you to engage in an amorous encounter (that does not have obviously harmful consequences) is treated as being in the same category as &#147;giving simple advice or directions.&#148; Conversely, your strong aura of sex appeal applies to all races and genders and alters their choices as well. If a creature has you in its power (when you are a prisoner, charmed, helpless, and so on) it must make a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) to take any act that would cause you serious physical harm or place you where the creature cannot visit you daily. You also gain a +5 bonus to Diplomacy checks to request a creature spend time with you in an area it believes to be private (not observed or inhabited by other creatures), may make such requests even against hostile creatures, and may make this request once a day even if previous requests to the same creature have failed." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

If you reject an amorous advance from a creature you have used this ability to improve the attitude of, its attitude reverts to its original level. Additionally, for four hours after slating your desire for physical affection you are inspired by the gratification you receive from such encounters. You receive a +1 morale bonus to one of the following (selected at the time you end your encounter): ability and skill checks tied to Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma (your choice); caster level; or weapon damage. You can only have one bonus from Lustful in effect at a time, and if you use the ability again before an old bonus fades, the original bonus immediately ends." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
