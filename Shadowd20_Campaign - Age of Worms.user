  <thing id="ioS2AposSc" name="The Apostolic Scrolls" description="This minor artifact of the cult of Kyuss, {b}is no longer magical{/b}, consists of a 5-foot-long sheet of vellum sewn to a pair of darkwood rollers. Several copies of the scrolls are thought to exist, and all have the same purpose - providing the user with the ability to contact one of the &quot;Apostles of Kyuss&quot; so it can perform a mass sacrifice in honor of its master. The scrolls are written in Abyssal and contain a long and complex litany filled with horrific imagery and descriptions. Performing this ritual takes 24 hours, but it can be split into three 8-hour shifts over the course of three days.\n\nOnce activated, the scrolls transport an ulgurstasta from the Wormcrawl Fissure to a single point within 100 feet of the scrolls as directed by the reader. The scrolls create a special containment sphere to protect the ulgurstasta during its growth period. The sphere is a 20-foot radius sphere of force similar to a {i}wall of force{/i}. The scrolls themselves are protected by {i}temporal stasis{/i}, and the two are connected by a beam of writhing green light.\n\nEach day that passes, the ulgurstasta gains 1d8 hit points, up to the maximum allowed by its hit dice (204 hit points for a 17-Hit-Die specimen). This hit point gain is permanent.\n\nDuring this stage, anyone who touches the scrolls can &quot;feel&quot; the ulgurstasta&apos;s evil mind and can communicate with it telepathically. The ulgurstasta is ready to perform the final portion of the ritual once it reaches maximum hit points The containment sphere is invisible, and feels like a cold, transparent barrier of rubbery material. The reader of the scrolls who created the sphere can touch it safely, but any other creature who touches it takes 12d6 points of damage from negative energy (DC 20 Fortitude save for half damage).\n\nThe reader of the {i}Apostolic Scrolls{/i} can cause the sphere to vanish at any time as a standard action. The sphere can also be destroyed in one of the following ways.\n\nEach copy of the {i}Apostolic Scrolls{/i} works only once. When the sphere of containment is taken down and the ulgurstasta within is released, the scrolls become nonmagical.\n\nThe lore within remains, however, and if consulted it grants a +4 bonus on any Knowledge (religion) checks made about Kyuss and his cult." compset="Wondrous">
