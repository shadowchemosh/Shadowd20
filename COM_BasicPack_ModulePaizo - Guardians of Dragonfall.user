  <thing id="fuSlowExha" name="Slow Exhalation" description="You have mastered a technique that allows you to release your breath weapon as you bite an opponent.\n\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Breath weapon, true dragon.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} You may expend your breath weapon in a continuous way, such that any successful bite attack also deals your breath weapon damage (no save). The slow exhalation of your breath weapon may be maintained for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus if your breath weapon is cone-shaped, or half that duration if it is line-shaped. Once you complete your slow exhalation, you must wait 1d4 rounds as normal before using your breath weapon again." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

The Will save DC for the suggestion is the same as that for your normal frightful presence ability. An opponent who successfully saves against the suggestion removes the effect of the frightful presence and is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="iouBellBro" name="Bellwether Brooch" description=" The creators of Dragonfall allowed for the possibility that at some point in the future, Dragonfall might require relocation. While they could not program the guardians with the flexibility of thought necessary to execute this task themselves, they did, through the Bellwether Brooch, allow the option for someone else to lead the guardians to a new location.\n\nAs long as the Bellwether Brooch resides in its setting in the Paragon Chamber of Dragonfall, the Guardians of Dragonfall follow their normal routines. If the Bellwether Brooch is removed from its setting, however, the guardians immediately stop performing these routines and await the commands of the brooch's wearer. As a free action, the wearer of the brooch can telepathically command any Guardians of Dragonfall within 100 feet, and the guardians obey fully. The guardians resume their normal routines if the brooch is replaced in its setting. In addition, the wearer of the brooch receives a +10 insight bonus on skill checks to craft constructs, is treated as 5 levels higher for the purposes of creating constructs, and need not expend XP in the creation of constructs.\n\nThe brooch is a clear diamond cut in an ovoid, two inches long. It has no chain or clasp; instead, it attaches itself to the wearer's skin at the neck. The wearer can easily remove it, but it is treated as a &#147;well-secured object&#148; against any attempts to remove it by force." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="iouHandThe" name="Hand of the Theurge" description="This large crystal, sized and shaped like a loosely clenched human fist, perfectly accepts any wand. As a standard action, the hand can be loosed to activate a wand on its own at any target within range. Any such activation costs 3 charges from the wand. The hand can activate the wand for up to 4 rounds and then drops. It is considered attended by you for all effects that target items, and it exists within your space. The hand of the theurge accompanies you everywhere, whether you move by physical or magical means. If you have an unoccupied hand, you can grasp it while it is activating on its own as a free action; when so retrieved, the hand can't animate again for 4 rounds.\n \n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Cost 8,000 gp" compset="Wondrous">

The spell only affects mindless constructs that are attuned to the commands of a master, such as animated objects, golems, retrievers, and shield guardians.

If the construct is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.\n\nThe spell enables you to control the construct completely, with the sole exception that commands directly resulting in damage break the spell.

The construct reverts to obeying the last commands given by its true master when the spell's duration expires.\n\nIf the construct's true master attempts to command a construct affected by apparent master, you must win an opposed Charisma check for the construct to continue to follow your commands.
