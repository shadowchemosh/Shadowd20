Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright.{br}{br}Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires.{br}{br}Though generally neutral, lizardfolks&apos; standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization&apos;s &quot;gifts,&quot; and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don&apos;t defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.{br}{br}The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment.

  <thing id="facS2Disre" name="Infamy and Disrepute" description="Some pirates only do what they do for the promise of wealth, being little more than brigands of the waves. Others do it for the reputation, fearsomeness, and power that comes with numbering among the most notorious scallywags on the seas. That&apos;s where Infamy comes in.\n\nNumerous times over the course of their careers, the PCs - as members of a single pirate crew - will have the opportunity to recount their victories, boast of the treasures they&apos;ve won, and spread tales of their outrages. All of this has the potential to win the PCs Infamy, but that alone isn&apos;t the goal. At the most basic level, infamous pirates have the potential to pressgang unfortunates into their crews, get repairs to their ships in nearly any port, and win discounts from merchants they&apos;d prefer not to rob. As a crew becomes more and more infamous, however, its legend stretches across the seas, allowing it to garner support from other pirate lords, win more favorable vessels, and even rally whole pirate armadas under its flag. This system allows characters to track how their legend is growing over the course of the campaign, along with providing them tangible rewards for building appropriately piratical reputations.\n\n{b}Infamy and Disrepute Scores:{/b} In a method similar to the tracking system for Fame and Prestige Points detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Pathfinder Society Field Guide, a party has two related scores, Infamy and Disrepute. Infamy tracks how many points of Infamy the crew has gained over its career - think of this as the sum of all the outlandish stories and rumors about the PCs being told throughout the Shackles. Infamy rarely, if ever, decreases, and reaching certain Infamy thresholds provides useful benefits and allows others to be purchased using points of Disrepute. Infamy is limited by actual skill, however, and a group&apos;s Infamy score can never be more than 4 × the PCs&apos; average party level.\n\nDisrepute is a spendable resource - a group&apos;s actual ability to cash in on its reputation. This currency is used to purchase impositions, deeds others might not want to do for the group, but that they perform either to curry the group&apos;s favor or to avoid its disfavor. This score will likely fluctuate over the course of a pirate crew&apos;s career and can go as high as the group&apos;s Infamy (but never higher), and at times might even drop to zero. This isn&apos;t something to worry about, though, as a low Disrepute score has no bearing on a crew&apos;s overall reputation - on the contrary, it merely means they&apos;re making use of the benefits their status has won them.\n\n{b}Winning Infamy and Disrepute:{/b} A few things are required to gain Infamy: an audience, a deed to tell about, and a flair for storytelling. Proof of the group&apos;s deed in the form of plunder doesn&apos;t hurt either. To gain Infamy, the PCs must moor their ship at a port for 1 full day, and the PC determined by the group to be its main storyteller must spend this time on shore carousing and boasting of infamous deeds. This PC must make either a Bluff, Intimidate, or Perform check to gauge the effectiveness of her recounting or embellishing. However, it does represent that even the PCs&apos; legend can only take them so far, and if a group&apos;s Disrepute drops lower than the Disrepute price of a benefit, the crew must spend time building its Disrepute back up before it can purchase that benefit.\n\n{b}Infamy and Disrepute per Port:{/b} No matter how impressionable (or drunk) the crowd, no one wants to hear the same tales and boasts over and over again. Thus, a group can only gain a maximum of 5 points of Infamy and Disrepute from any particular port. However, this amount resets every time a group reaches a new Infamy threshold. Thus, once a group gains 5 points of Infamy and Disrepute in Quent, it can gain no further points of Infamy from that port until it reaches the next Infamy threshold, though the crew can travel to another port and gain more Infamy by boasting to a new audience." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">
