In this case any hit by the hammer, whether critical or not, that would reduce the devourer to 0 hp or below causes the normal {i}heal/harm{/i} effect as described above and also effects the wielder with a {i}blasphemy{/i} (caster level 20).The curse effect of this weapon cannot be learned through an {i}identify{/i} or {i}analyze dweomer{/i}.\n\nIt is possible that the curse on this hammer may be lifted and it be redeemed as the {i}Hammer of the Three Gods{/i} (see Event 8 in Chapter 1 of {b}{i}Slumbering Tsar: The Hidden Citadel, Part 1 - At the Feet of Orcus{/b}{/i}). If that occurs, the curse effects described above are lifted and it becomes simply a {i}+4 adamantine holy thundering warhammer{/i}.  A side note of the ownership of the hammer is that it also serves as a symbol of office. Mordecai was the last rightful patriarch of St. Harul&apos;s Hold who, in honor of the lost goddess, was a cleric of both Thyr and Muir. The new holder of the weapon is also the rightful patriarch of St. Harul&apos;s Hold and thus Tsar and its surrounding environs. Now it is possible that a PC willing to take levels in cleric devoted to either of those deities (or perhaps Kel herself as discussed in the &quot;Concluding the Adventure&quot; section of Chapter 13 in {b}{i}Part 6 - Caverns of the Barrier{/b}{/i}) can actually become that patriarch.  However if not, the PC can still claim rightful rulership over the hold even if only in a secular sense. If the PC is not evil and is willing to allow those churches to re-establish their clerical presence in Tsar, they would honor the position conferred by the hammer and let that individual govern as the secular authority until passing to the next patriarch upon his or her death.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}\nIf a Patriarch of St. Harul&apos;s Hold is slain by the hammer or brought to his doom by the hammer&apos;s curse, the {i}Hammer of Mordecai&apos;s Doom{/i} will crumble to rusting fragments." compset="MagicWep" summary="This massive two-handed warhammer is a {i}+4 adamantine holy thundering warhammer{/i}." uniqueness="unique">

If the seal is broken, the interior is seen to hold a small amount of fine ash. This legendary item is (truthfully) said to hold the remains of the last vizier of the Tu Chai Palace, the powerful ogre mage Amnu-Paket. The Tu Chai Palace is considered an equally mythical palace said to have existed an age ago in the exotic lands of the north hanging from the side of a magnificent peak. Amnu-Paket was considered both the wisest of sages and a cruel despot, and the holder of his ashes was rumored to both benefit from his wisdom and suffer from bad luck. The {i}ashes of Amnu-Paket{/i} disappeared long ago from the knowledge of man.  Actually the receptacle was secreted within a hidden compartment inside the fabulously-carved emerald called the Tu Chai Palace. Thus the owner of the emerald receives both the benefits and penalties associated with the ashes, more than likely never even realizing the source of the effects.\n\nThe individual who owns the ashes (or the Tu Chai Palace if they are still hidden within) is the continual recipient of the following effects: a +4 increase to his Wisdom score in the form of an enhancement bonus, a +5 insight bonus on any Knowledge checks, and a -2 luck penalty on all saves and ability checks. The owner does not have to have the ashes in his possession; he merely has to be the recognized owner of them (or the emerald if applicable). If an entire party claims the emerald as a treasure, it is the individual responsible for its storage who receives the benefits and penalties.  The curse of bad luck cannot be removed from the item. The only way to rid oneself of the penalties is to have the item stolen, sell it, or give it away to another individual.

  <thing id="ioUmGaTirK" name="Cursed Game of Tirleng-Ka" description="This infamous game board is a chess set of alternating alabaster and malachite squares. The playing pieces are likewise composed of alabaster and malachite respectively. It was said to have been created a thousand years ago by the military genius Tirleng-ka. Legends say that no army led by the general could be defeated in battle. He was often noted as saying that the battlefield is like a chess match, and he would actually set up a game board in his command tent before a battle and play out a game through the course of the actual battle.  It wasn&apos;t until later that one of his subordinates learned the truth; the battle truly was only a game to the general. He would play out the match against himself and order his troop maneuvers during the battle based on his moves in the game. Such was his skill at chess that he never failed to achieve victory, even though sometimes at an atrocious cost in lives.\n\nWhen the rumors ran through the ranks of his officers and soldiers, men who had served him faithfully through dozens of campaigns, accepting the horrible tolls sometimes exacted as a necessary part of war, realized he had been playing games with their lives on a whim and had needlessly sent thousands to their deaths. His once-loyal forces mutinied in a howling bloodthirsty mob and found him in his command tent playing another game.  They seized their general and flayed him alive, his blood splattering all over the chess match in progress. Strangely, when the deed was done, they found the chess board and pieces unsullied. The officers took the game board and pieces as spoils and divided the semi-precious stones among themselves. Thus in blood and betrayal was born the {i}cursed game of Tirleng-ka.{/i}\n\nIt wasn&apos;t until years later when the pieces and board were finally reunited by chance, that the magical powers they possessed were discovered.  Whether these powers had been present all along or only manifested due to the nature of the general&apos;s death is unknown. Regardless the new owner used the board&apos;s powers to become a powerful war-captain in his own right. It was also he, however, that discovered the curse of the game as well, when his officers betrayed him and hung him from the support pole of his own tent. Once again, the pieces were divided as spoils. Over the centuries, the pieces have been assembled only a few other times, each time the new owner was able to use the powers of the board to achieve great militarily victories only to end his life in betrayal and murder by his own men. The last owner was slain during the Battle of Tsar. The pieces were deliberately separated and hidden to prevent anyone from ever again gaining their power and suffering the inevitable fate, though there is always someone willing to look, thinking that they will be the one who is finally able to beat the curse.\n\nAs a finely crafted game board of alabaster and malachite, the item is worth 800 gp, and each individual piece (16 in all) is worth another 50 gp. However, only when the board and all of the pieces are assembled, does it begin to radiate a magical dweomer and the owner have access to its powers.\n\nTo use the powers of the game, the wielder must spend 10 minutes setting up the board and arranging the pieces properly before the magic will function. Typically, field commanders did this in the safety of their tents overlooking the coming battlefield. Once the allotted time is spent in assembly, the wielder and all of his allies within line of effect out to any range gain a +2 insight bonus on their attack and damage rolls. If the board was assembled before the battle is joined, all allies gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative as well. Furthermore the weapons of all the wielder&apos;s effected allies are treated as aligned like the wielder&apos;s alignment for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. These effects remain as long as the wielder remains by the board surveying the field of battle. If the board is upset, the effects are lost until another 10 minutes is spent preparing it. The wielder may fight and take actions to defend the board, but the effect ends if he steps more than 5 feet away, in which case it must be once again reset.\n\nBy manipulating pieces on the board (individually or as groups listed below) as a full-round action, the wielder can create additional effects as listed below. All effects are at caster level 20th.\n\n&#149; Malachite Pawn (8) - casts {i}bless{/i} on all allies within 30 ft. once per day (stacks with insight bonuses).\n&#149; All Malachite Pawns (1) - functions as a {i}bronze horn of Valhalla{/i} once per hour.\n&#149; Malachite Rook (2) - casts {i}wall of iron{/i} once per day.\n&#149; Malachite Knight (2) - casts {i}magic fang{/i} on all allied Animals within 100 ft. once per day.\n&#149; Malachite Bishop (2) - casts {i}fl ame strike{/i} once per day.\n&#149; Malachite Queen (1) - functions as a {i}horn of blasting{/i} 3/day.\n&#149; Malachite King (1) - functions as a {i}rod of rulership{/i} once per day for up to 60 minutes at a time.\n&#149; Malachite Castle* (1) - casts {i}insect plague{/i} once per day.\n&#149; Alabaster Pawn (8) - casts {i}virtue{/i} on all allies within 30 ft. once per day.\n&#149; All Alabaster Pawns (1) - casts {i}shield of faith{/i} on all allies within 100 ft once per hour.\n&#149; Alabaster Rook (2) - casts {i}globe of invulnerability{/i} once per day.\n&#149; Alabaster Knight (2) - creates effects of {i}horseshoes of zephyr{/i} on all allies&apos; mounts within 100 ft. once per day.\n&#149; Alabaster Bishop (2) - casts {i}divine power{/i} on all allies within 10 ft. once per day.\n&#149; Alabaster Queen (1) - casts {i}blade barrier{/i} 3/day.\n&#149; Alabaster King (1) - casts {i}status{/i} on all allies within one mile once per day.\n&#149; Alabaster Castle* (1) - casts {i}mass cure light wounds{/i} on all allies within 300 ft. once per day.\n\nEach individual piece can be moved as many times as described within its entry. In addition they can be used in conjunction with other pieces to activate those specific powers as well. Thus each malachite pawn can be used to cast a {i}bless{/i} once per day and then all the malachite pawns can be used to invoke the powers of a {i}bronze horn of Valhalla{/i}. The bonuses from similar pieces don&apos;t stack on the same creatures unless they have already worn off. Otherwise different allies will have to come within range for the effect to work again. Next to each entry is a parenthetical number showing the numbers of that piece present on the board and thus, the number of times that power can be used during the specified time period.\n\n*Castle - This involves maneuvering a king and one of the rooks of a like color. This function can only be used if neither that king nor the rook in question has already been moved previously in the battle.\n\nThe alleged curse on the game is up to you. It could be that all of the previous owners have met unfortunate ends due to coincidence, using the magic item callously and ultimately alienating their subordinates. Feel free to come up with something suitably grievous for your campaign. Regardless it should not be something that occurs soon, each of the prior owners having used the item to great effect for some time before meeting his fate. Build up the suspense of the presumed curse through foreshadowing and dropping veiled hints.  Even if there is actually no curse, it should keep the players nervous and on their toes waiting for the headsman&apos;s axe to fall.\n\n{b}Destruction{/b}: \nIf the game is set up and used in a battle which the wielder then deliberately loses and is himself killed with his blood spilling upon the game board, then it loses its magical properties, though perhaps not its sinister reputation.\n\n{b}Note{/b}: There has been no coding done with this due to the amount of variables." compset="Wondrous">
