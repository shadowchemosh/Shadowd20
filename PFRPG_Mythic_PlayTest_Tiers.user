-Now that Classes.? and Hero.HitDice tags are removed didn't need the adjustment of -1 per Tier to the tLevel Field.  This was removed as it confused the Ability Score increase the character gets every 4 levels.

November 23, 2012 - Tim Shadow
-Added in "Mythic Tier" header XML that Mathias was nice to provide. This will cause the Paths to correctly display under the "Mythic Tier" class now.

November 14, 2012 - Tim Shadow

Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class, in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are not gained in the same manner. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. As such, achieving a new mythic tier occurs independently of the ordinary experience point progression. The number of trials required to attain each new tier appears on Table 1-1. For example, a 5th-level fighter discovers his mythic heritage and becomes a 1st-tier champion. Over a number of sessions, he earns enough experience points to gain his 6th level of fighter. During this time, he accomplishes all three lesser trials, but not his greater trial, so he does not achieve the next tier of champion. During the next session, he finally accomplishes a greater trial, allowing him to become a 2nd-tier champion. To reach 3rd tier, he will need to accomplish another 4 lesser trials and 2 more greater trials.\n\nMythic trials in excess of those needed to gain the next tier do not count toward the following tier. Instead, whenever a character completes a trial in excess of those needed to gain a tier, he immediately regains one daily use of his mythic power, up to his daily maximum.\n\n{B}Note:{/b} You pick your mythic path as an Archetype after you take your first level in a Mythic Tier.
