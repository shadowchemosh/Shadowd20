On opposing sides of the cage frame, two large bolts can be adjusted to hold a humanoid head in a stationary position within. When a head is placed inside and the command word is spoken, you can sequester information from it as if it were under the effect of a speak with dead spell. The cage can coerce three answers per day, which do not need to be from the same head or asked in a limited period of time (for example, you could ask a kobold's head a question in the morning, an orc's head a question in the afternoon, and an ogre's head a question in the evening).\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead; Cost 5,000 gp" compset="Wondrous">

If you rub the first piece on a weapon it acts as a potion of haste. If you eat the second piece it acts as a potion of cure serious wounds. If you eat the third piece it acts as a potion of protection from fire, absorbing 60 points of damage before losing its effectiveness, but any round you take fire damage causes you to cough sticky black smoke like a pan of grease on fire (harmless to you or others but disturbing to see or experience).

The glass tube is scrawled with hundreds of mystic sigils and filled with strange tubes and fluids. Bolts around the iron lip of the tube allow it to be fastened into the wearers flesh, while dozens of tubes and probes connect to the wearer's upper body. The device is designed for a creature lacking a lower body or at least missing its legs; it can only effectively be used by undead, as a living creature would almost certainly die from the item grafting itself to his body and removing extraneous flesh to do so (though the character could be raised from the dead or animated as an undead after this death).

When the command word is spoken and two charges are expended, the sinew folds back revealing the petrified eyeball of some mammoth beast. The petrified eye functions in a similar fashion to a crystal ball, allowing the user to see events through the eyes of his minions. Drazmorg can use his staff to project his voice from any minion he is currently scrying through, allowing him to usher warnings and threats over great distances, as well as command his spawn. It losese this ability after its charges are consumed.\n\nIn addition, the staff allows the use of the following spells:\n\n    clairaudience/clairvoyance (1 charges)\n    detect scrying (2 charges)\n\nThe staff is linked to Drazmorg and the seeping energy of the broken Seal. When Drazmorg dies, the staff bends and twists like a wounded snake, then shudders and becomes inert, its eye open and staring. The petrified eyeball retains some of its power, functioning as an eye of scrying, and can be pried or cut out of the &#147;dead&#148; staff without harming its abilities.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Craft Staff, clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect scrying, scrying; Cost 12,500 gp" compset="Staff" uniqueness="unique">
