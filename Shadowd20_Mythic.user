  <thing id="fS2MyPowAt" name="Power Attack" description="Your attacks are truly devastating.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Power Attack.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to increase your Power Attack damage for one round. You gain a +3 bonus on melee damage rolls instead of +2. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every 4 points thereafter, the amount of bonus damage increases by +3 instead of +2. In addition, the bonus damage from this feat is doubled on a critical hit, before it&apos;s multiplied by the weapon&apos;s critical multiplier.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} The bonus displayed on this feat is the amount of damage you should multiply by your weapon&apos;s critical multiplier when you critically hit.\n\n{b}Shadow d20:{/b} This feat is changed to so that a mythic point needs to be spent to activate the extra damage for one round. The mythic damage increase all the time was seen as too after I ran through Wrath of the Righteous." compset="Feat" summary="Use 1 power to eliminate attack penalties of Power attack for 1 min." uniqueness="useronce">
