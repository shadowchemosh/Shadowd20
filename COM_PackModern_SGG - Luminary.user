  <thing id="cMPSGGInfl" name="Influence" description="A luminary&apos;s powerful personality, compelling motivation, and keen understanding of what motivates people allow her to influence the actions of her allies and enemies. The influence of a luminary is not a generic aura of encouragement that aids everything her friends do and hinders all her foes; instead it represents specific, measured moments when the luminary exerts her persuasive demeanor (and possibly her celebrity) to drive her collaborators to great deeds, or to cause her foes to stumble and fail.\n\nA luminary may use her influence ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1/day). She gains one additional daily use of influence at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Normally, a subject must  be  able  to  see  and  hear  a  luminary  in order to be affected by the influence ability. If a luminary is aware that a target can only see or hear her, she may expend two daily uses of the influence ability to have it work anyway.\nA creature does not have to understand a luminary to be affected by influence, but it must have an Int of at least 2. All uses of influence are considered mind-affecting effects. A luminary cannot affect herself with her own influence ability.\n\nA luminary may create the following effects with her influence.\n\n{b}Harass{/b}: The luminary can use her speech, tone of voice, gestures and timing to make it difficult for a foe to focus on what he is doing. As an immediate or swift action, the luminary can force a foe to reroll any one successful attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or damage roll. The luminary may make this decision after the roll has been revealed to succeed, but before any consequences of that success are known. (Thus a luminary can force a foe to reroll a successful attack roll with a sword after the attack is known to have hit, but before its damage has been rolled.)\n\n{b}Spur To Action{/b}: As an immediate or swift action the luminary can grant an additional action to any ally. This may be a swift action (taken on the ally&apos;s turn) or a +1 increase to the number of attacks of opportunity the ally may take before its next turn. At 8th level, the luminary may instead grant an ally an additional move action taken on its turn or a swift action taken at any time. At 16th level, the luminary may instead grant an ally an additional standard action taken on its turn or a move action taken at any time.\n\n{b}Steadfast Support{/b}: The luminary can convince an ally that an apparently hopeless situation can, in fact, be overcome. As an immediate or swift action, the luminary can allow an ally to reroll any one failed attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or damage roll. The luminary  may  make  this  decision  after  the roll has been revealed to fail, but before any consequences of that failure are known. (Thus a luminary can give an ally a reroll for a failed Reflex saving throw against a fireball, but only before the spell&apos;s damage is known).\n\n{b}Unsettle{/b}: Through a combination of words, tone, gestures, and obvious attitude, a luminary can throw a foe off his game. A luminary instinctively  customizes her unsettling to match her target -frightening cautious mooks, flirting with stalwart guardians, and enraging powerful warlords. The end result is the same her manipulation of her targets&apos; emotions causes them to be temporarily unable to fully focus on what they are doing.\n \nAs a standard action, the luminary forces a foe to make a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 the luminary&apos;s class level + the luminary&apos;s Charisma modifier). If the foe fails its save, it suffers a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, ability checks, concentration checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round/2 levels (minimum\n1 round)." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Influence the actions of her allies and enemies" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPSGGFTkD" name="Talk Down" description="A fixer prefers to avoid messy violence altogether, though sometimes a deal goes south, a contact goes bad, or (worst of all) a client demands a refund. But even when blades are drawn or bullets start flying, a fixer may be able to talk her way out of trouble. \n\nAs a full-round action a fixer can talk down a single opponent within able to hear and understand the fixer&apos;s voice. The fixer must make a Diplomacy check (DC 15 + target&apos;s level or hit dice), and even then the target receives a Will save (DC 10 + fixer&apos;s 1/2 class level + fixer&apos;s Charisma bonus). The target receives a +1 bonus for each time it has seen the fixer talk down another target in the past 24 hours.\n\nIf the target makes its save, it is unaffected. If it fails the save, its attitude toward the fixer and her becomes indifferent, and it immediately stops fighting (though it defends itself normally). Any hostile action by the fixer against the target negates this ability, while a hostile action taken by one of the fixer&apos;s allies directed at the target ends this ability with regards to that ally, and grants the target a new saving throw with a +5 bonus to end the entire effect.\n\nAn indifferent creature normally doesn&apos;t fight for anyone, but the target&apos;s allies may make opposed Diplomacy or Bluff checks each round to convince it to return to attacking the fixer. Most creatures that do not have a strong ideological reason to hate the fixer can be convinced it is in their best interest to leave a conflict if the fixer and her allies appear to be winning, or may be temporarily bought off with a payment of (10 gp x target&apos;s hit dice x target&apos;s hit dice). Unless convinced by allies otherwise, the target of a successful talk down always at least gives the fixer a number of rounds equal to the fixer&apos;s Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round) to make an offer before renewing hostilities. A fixer may use talk down once per day, plus once for every two levels." compset="CustomSpec" summary="A fixer prefers to avoid messy violence altogether" uniqueness="unique">
