At each level after 5th a wise guy can\nuse fearful inspiration for 2 additional rounds per day.\n\nStarting a fearful inspiration is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Fearful inspiration cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the wise guy is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round.\n\nAt 9th level, a wise guy can start a fearful inspiration as a move action instead of a standard action. \n\nAt 13th level, a wise guy can start a fearful inspiration as a swift action.\n\nTargets must be able to hear the wise guy for the fearful inspiration to have any effect, and it is language dependent. Deaf creatures, and those immune to fear, gain no benefits from a fearful inspiration. An ally may choose to take no benefit from a wise guy&apos;s fearful inspiration.\n \nEach round, all allies affected by a wise guy&apos;s fearful inspiration may choose to use his Charisma bonus in place of one of their ability scores for a specific purpose. Allies may choose to use the wise guy&apos;s bonus in place of their Strength or Dexterity modifier to calculate attack bonuses, in place of their Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom modifier (as appropriate) to calculate their Fort, Ref, or Will save, or in place of an ability modifier used to calculate a saving throw for one specific spell or ability. \n\nEach round an ally may choose what specific modifier calculation to replace with the wise guy&apos;s bonus as a free action at the start of the ally&apos;s turn. An ally can only use the wise guy&apos;s bonus for a single modifier - an ally using the wise guy&apos;s Charisma bonus to calculate ranged attack rolls instead of the ally&apos;s Dexterity does not also get to use the wise guy&apos;s bonus for reflex saves.\n\nSeeing people inspired by their concern for his wrath also boosts the wise guy&apos;s morale. If he can see and hear at least one ally or follower taking a bonus from his fearful inspiration, the wise guy gains a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, skill and ability checks, and saving throws. This bonus increases to +3 at 10th level, and by an additional +1 every 5 levels thereafter." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Warn his allies and minions how displeased he will be" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="manMPSGGBz" name="Buzz" description="{b}Vehicle Maneuvers - Move Action{/b}:  The driver hugs his vehicle very close to dangerous terrain features. This maneuver can include flying low to the ground in aircraft, weaving through traffic or difficult terrain on a motorcycle, taking an atomic rocket through a dense asteroid field, or even making sharp turns down narrow alleys in a getaway car. A buzz maneuver is only possible if terrain exists that can pose a threat to the vehicle (GM&apos;s discretion). A buzz maneuver can be taken as a swift action in any round the driver makes another vehicular maneuver.\n\nWhen a driver decides to make a buzz maneuver, he declares a DC he is attempting for the maneuver (which represents how dangerous a buzz he is attempting, often defined by how close he is getting to dangerous terrain or obstacles). If his VCB check is successful against the DC, any vehicle attempting to perform a close, dogfight, or ram maneuver against the buzzing vehicle must make a VCB check at the same DC (as a free action) or automatically fail. Any vehicle following the driver&apos;s vehicle that does not make one of these maneuvers falls back two distance intervals.\nAny vehicle that fails a buzz maneuver by 5 or more strikes some piece of terrain and takes damage as if it had rammed a vehicle bigger than itself (see ram, below).\n \nOccasionally, terrain requires vehicles perform a buzz maneuver at a specific DC in order to perform any other vehicular maneuvers (such as driving through a   forest, of flying between buildings) as determined by the GM." compset="ManType" summary="The driver hugs his vehicle very close to dangerous terrain features">
