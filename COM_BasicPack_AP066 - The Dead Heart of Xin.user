  <thing id="iAP66AbyLS" name="Abysium Longsword of Lifestealing" description="This abysium {i}+2 longsword{/i} bestows a negative level when it deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level gained or they become permanent.\n\n{b}Abyssium{/b} Known also as feverstone (a somewhat misleading name, as abysium is a metal like all the others), this glowing, blue-green substance can be a source of great energy. However, it also causes those who spend extended amounts of time near it to grow ill and die unless proper precautions are taken. Abysium is associated with conjuration magic, zeal, and sloth. Abysium functions as steel when used to craft weapons and armor, but anyone who carries or wears abysium arms or armor becomes sickened for as long as the gear is carried or worn, plus an additional 1d4 hours after it is removed. Likewise, a character in an area with heavy concentrations of abysium becomes sickened as long as he remains in the area. This is a poison effect. In Thassilon, wealthy lords often built manacles or prison bars out of Abysium in order to keep their prisoners debilitated. \n\n{b}Construction{/b}\n{b}Requirements{/b}: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, {i}enervation{/i}; {b}Cost{/b} 13,015 gp" compset="MagicWep">
