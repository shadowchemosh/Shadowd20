All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become frighted for 2d4 rounds.

  <thing id="pAP85Zagma" name="Specific Individual: Zagmaander" description="This long cavern has long been the home of a powerful outsider—a xill sorcerer named Zagmaander. The xill has dwelled here for hundreds of years, and is perhaps Scrapwall’s oldest living denizen, yet this is not entirely her choice. Zagmaander originally came to Numeria to hunt among the Ghost Wolves, a tribe of barbarians who claim a large portion of the Sellen Hills as their territory. Zagmaander preyed upon them for decades, building herself a reputation as the “Blood Ghost” until she was finally confronted by a powerful Kellid oracle who cursed her, binding her body to this realm and wracking her with pain. No longer able to retreat to her home on the Ethereal Plane, Zagmaander found herself stranded in a world she detested. The xill retreated into hiding in Scrapwall, and in time her presence there was noted by a tribe of dark folk. Her attempts to prey upon them failed, for the disintegration of their bodies when they died left her young nothing to feed upon, but when the terrified dark folk took to worshiping her and bringing her offerings of suitable incubators for her young, the xill finally began the long process of learning to cope with her cursed existence. She still hopes to escape her curse, either by growing powerful enough to lift the curse herself or by finding an agent willing to do the job for her. She’d hoped that the Lords of Rust could help her, and she originally agreed to join Hellion’s group in return for Meyanda’s promise to lift the curse as soon as the android was able. Unfortunately, Meyanda mastered the ability to cast remove curse only a few days before she was sent on her fateful mission to Torch, and was unable to overcome the xill’s curse before she vanished. Since then, the xill has grown increasingly impatient to be free of this world—suicide has never before been a serious option for the xill, who views such a tactic as cowardly and one that would rob the world of her future children, yet now realizes that her death may her only release, now that Meyanda has vanished.\n\nThe xill likely knows who the PCs are—Hellion updated her as soon as it noticed their arrival. The xill is no fool; she swiftly realized that these adventurers might be her key to freedom. She smashed both of the monitors near her nest so when the PCs do finally arrive, she can speak to them without having Hellion overhear. The xill’s proposal is simple—if the PCs can lift the curse from her, she’ll help them however they wish. She initially offers her laser torch and bracers as a reward, but she also agrees to help the PCs fight against Hellion and the Lords of Rust if asked. Although evil, the xill honors any bargain she strikes with the PCs—but she provides her promised reward only if they successfully remove her curse. If the PCs refuse or are unable to lift her curse, Zagmaander shakes her head in disappointment but then observes that while they cannot offer her the magical assistance she needs, they can surely offer the physical aid she desires—by which she means offering their flesh for her endless young. She attacks the PCs at once, hoping to immobilizing them all and leave them alive to serve as incubators." compset="InPlay" uniqueness="unique">

The robot treats this attack as if it were a manufactured weapon, not a natural attack—it can make iterative attacks with the plasma beam, and the integrated weapon can be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts). It cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot’s body, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. The plasma beam deals 2d6 points of damage on a hit (half of which is fire damage and half of which is electricity damage), has a range increment of 50 feet, and is semi-automatic (see page 20 of the Technology Guide)." compset="RaceSpec">

  <thing id="pAP85HellC" name="Specific Individual: Hellion&apos;s Chasis" description=" When Unity first sent Hellion out into the world, it loaded its newly crafted AI into the central processor of a unique arachnid robot, one larger than most of its kind. This size increase was in large part driven by the fact that an enormous amount of processing power and memory was needed to house the complex AI program, but also because Unity wanted its progeny to have a fearsome shape. Had that initial test gone well, Unity intended to place the AI in a much larger robot—an enhanced annihilator robot. But when Hellion set foot outside Silver Mount and immediately gained free will, those plans came to an abrupt end.\n\nHellion hasn’t physically exited this chamber for centuries. Every few months, the AI powers up its robot body and moves around to make sure all systems remain functional, but it is otherwise content to explore its own mind and play with manipulating the desires, fears, and adoration of its worshipers via the monitors and hologram projectors. The AI understands the passage of time, yet is not worried by it.\n\nAt least, it wasn’t worried until its plan began to falter, in large part because of the PCs’ interference. As a result, Hellion is, for the first time, beginning to worry. It hopes to solve the problem of the meddling heroes via its minions and robots, but knows there is a possibility the PCs might reach it here at the core of its defenses. In such an event, it is prepared to take action, using its robotic body and any remaining spell-like abilities to their fullest to slay the PCs.\n\nHellion recently called three scrapyard robots down from the excavator to act as its personal guard; it sends these three robots to attack the PCs initially. If Hellion’s chassis is destroyed before all three of the scrapyard robots are destroyed, the AI attempts a last-ditch gambit and tries to download itself into the processors of the surviving scrapyard robots. This doesn’t go as well as planned, though, since the scrapyard robots aren’t built to contain a program as complex as an AI—the scrapyard robots become staggered and act as if confused for 1 hour after this occurs. Should one of these robots somehow survive that hour, a diminished version of Hellion may well emerge within that robot’s diminished processors—a foe that could well come back to haunt the PCs at a later date if you wish." compset="InPlay" uniqueness="unique">
