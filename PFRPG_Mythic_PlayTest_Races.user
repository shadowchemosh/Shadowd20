If the creature already has damage reduction, it adds epic to the qualities needed to bypass that reduction and increases that damage reduction if the damage reduction granted from this subtype is greater.{br}{br}{i}Spell Resistance{/i}: A creature with spell resistance adds its mythic rank to its spell resistance.{br}{br}{i}Mythic Power{/i}: The creature can use mythic power, as the base mythic ability (see page 4), a number of times per day equal to its mythic rank. The die type depends on mythic rank as indicated on the table below.{br}{br}{i}Ability Bonus{/i}: The creature gains a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score upon reaching the 2nd mythic tier.
