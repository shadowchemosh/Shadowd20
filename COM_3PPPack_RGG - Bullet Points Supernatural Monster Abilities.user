  <thing id="pMDblRege" name="Doubling Regeneration" description="At the beginning of its turn after one of the monster&#146;s limbs is severed, two limbs grow back in its place. A limb is considered to have been severed anytime a slashing weapon scores a critical hit, deals more damage than the monster&#146;s Constitution score, the first time a slashing weapon damages it after the monster is below half hit points, and any time a rule effect specifies a limb has been severed (as may be the case when using critical hit card decks or charts). Determine which limb is severed randomly.\n\nEach additional limb gained by the monster gives it one additional secondary attack. These are equal to its best limb-based attack (normally a melee weapon, slam, or claw attack), but have an attack bonus equal to the monster&#146;s best melee attack bonus -5, and add only half the monster&#146;s Strength bonus to damage dealt. \n\nSlashing damage from sources that also deal acid or fire damage (such as a flaming weapon) do not cause two limbs to grow back when they sever a limb. After a limb has been severed but before it grows back (at the beginning of the monster&#146;s next turn), a foe may deal fire damage to the monster in the hopes of preventing two limbs from growing back. The monster must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 points of fire damage dealt) to successfully regrow two limbs if it takes fire damage after a limb is severed.\n\n{b}CR Modifier{/b}: +1\n\n{b}Note{/b}: The adjustment changes the number of hands the creature currently has." compset="InPlay">
