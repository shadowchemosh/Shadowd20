  <thing id="spMOMacInv" name="Machine Invisibility" description="The creature or object touched cannot be detected by video cameras, electronic sensors, or other high-tech detection machines. The creature is also invisible to mechanical constructs such as gear golems, digital homunculi, and mechanical homunculi. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear is likewise undetectable. The subject is missing from still photos taken while the spell is in effect, closed-circuit television monitors don&apos;t display the subject, and other machines are likewise fooled. The creature or object touched can stand on a scale and doesn&apos;t appear to weigh anything. \n\nInfrared and heat sensors detect only the ambient heat levels. X-ray machines don&apos;t reveal the presence of an object with machine invisibility. Microphones don&apos;t pick up sounds that the subject makes directly, although they will pick up sounds that subject makes by interacting with the environment. A hidden microphone wouldn&apos;t hear the subject&apos;s voice but would record the sound of that creature throwing a brick through a window. Items dropped or put down by an affected creature become visible to machine detectors; items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or a bag carried by the creature. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect in a photograph or video image is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.\n\nThe spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an &quot;attack&quot; includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character&apos;s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. If the subject attacks directly, however, the subject and its gear immediately becomes visible to machines.\n\nWhile machine invisibility is useful for many tasks requiring stealth, it sometimes makes the subject&apos;s life more difficult. A stoplight sensor under an intersection might not pick up a motorcycle with machine invisibility. Automatic sliding doors at the supermarket won&apos;t open for the subject of machine invisibility. Talking on the telephone or radio is impossible.\n\nFocus: A glass lens, which the caster fogs by breathing on it." compset="Spell" summary="One creature or object cannot be detected by machines.">

  <thing id="spMPMagMs" name="Magic Message" description="This spell imbues a modern device such as a television, radio, computer monitor, or news ticker with a message you set that’s delivered when a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 words or less, is delivered in a manner appropriate to the device targeted by the spell. A newscaster on a targeted television will appear to speak the message. A stereo plays the message as a repetitive song lyric. An electronic traffic sign displays the message for all motorists to see. \n\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or specific as desired, although only visiual and audible triggers can be used such as the following: “Deliver the message when a man in a dark suit walks past with a gun drawn.” Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger (it’s common for a television to flicker to life in a dark apartment, delivering a magic message). Magical darkness and invisibility will defeat a visual trigger, however, and silent movement and magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, elevator music) or to a specific noise or a spoken work. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, “Deliver the message when any creature picks up the talking doll” is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic message cannot distinguish class, level, Hit Dice, or allegiance. \n\nThe range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic message to respond to triggers up to 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the magic message can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. \n\nMaterial Component: A carved jade figurine." compset="Spell" summary="Device delivers a message of 25 words or less when specific conditions are met.">

These watches are only found, as the secret of their manufacture has been lost.\n \nOnce per day, the tempus fugit watch can make time cease to flow for everyone but the wearer. In reality, the wearer speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are moving at their regular speed. The wearer is free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to the wearer’s attacks and spells. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop (such as cloudkill) have their normal effects on other creatures once the time-stopping effect ends. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm the wearer during the time stop. The wearer cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but the wearer can affect any item that is not in another creature’s possession. The wearer is not detectable while the effect lasts.\n \nThere is a 1% chance per use that the watch ceases to function after its last use.

Given the age of the specimen, this seems patently impossible, but its previous owners have been unwilling to submit the crescent to scientific examination. Experts estimate that it was made during the early iron age, though why one would make a stone blade when metal ones were widely available, no one can say. The crescent has a long and colorful history as an object both desired and feared by pagan sects.\n \nThis +3 scythe, with images of the lunar cycle and baying wolves carved into its shaft, also has the quality of lycanthrope bane (gaining an additional +2 enhancement bonus and dealing an additional +2d6 points of damage to werewolves, wererats, and other lycanthropes).\n \nThe crescent of the moon has other enchantments that activate only during specific phases of the lunar cycle. The following effects are active only from dusk to dawn on the days in question:\n \nNew Moon: On the three nights of the new moon, the crescent grants its wielder the ability to recognize lycanthropes by sight regardless of their current form—humanoid, hybrid, or animal.\n \nWaxing: During the period of time between new and full moon, the crescent grants its wielder darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\n \nFull Moon: On the three nights of the full moon, the crescent grants its wielder the ability to throw himself into a violent rage once per night. This rage lasts 1d4+3 rounds, and the wielder cannot choose to end it prematurely. Beginning a rage is a free action. In the rage, the wielder temporarily gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but suffers a –2 penalty to AC. The increased Constitution increases the wielder’s hit points by 2 per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when the Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, the wielder can take no action other than attacking; if there are no foes to attack, he must forfeit all actions until the rage has passed—he does not have to attack his friends. At the end of the rage, the wielder is fatigued (–2 to Strength, –2 to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for 1d4+3 rounds. The wielder may only fly into a rage during his action, not in response to somebody else’s action. \n\nWaning: During the period of time between full and new moon, the crescent grants its wielder the scent special quality." compset="MagicWep">

One swallow cures all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage, and all temporary ability damage. It also neutralizes poisons in the drinker’s system (so that no additional damage or effects are suffered) and cures mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain.\n \nA second swallow in the same sitting removes negative levels and restores permanently drained levels and ability scores.\n \nA third swallow grants the drinker a +5 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks for one day.\n \nA fourth swallow causes the drinker to glow with a brilliant white light. One round later, as the light grows brighter, anyone looking at the person must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be struck blind for 2d6 minutes. On the next round, the drinker’s body is completely consumed as the light flares—anyone still watching must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 35) or be struck permanently blind. The following round the light ceases, and the cup of curing disappears along with any trace of the greedy drinker. No spell can divine where the cup goes or when it will surface again.\n \nA character may drink from the cup on up to five different occasions. The sixth time, he immediately suffers consequences identical to drinking four times in a sitting.\n \nDrinking from the cup is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity." compset="Wondrous">

The fetish is a crude, tiny carving of a human figure with strange glyphs gouged into its chest and back. Houdini, it is said, was never seen without this fob hooked to his belt—never, that is, except for the night that he died.\n \nIn the intervening years, the fob has passed through the hands of several collectors, all of whom swear that they will give the artifact a permanent home.

The fob, it seems, does not want to stay in one place.\n \nAnyone wearing the fob gains a +3 luck bonus on Reflex saves, as well as a +6 luck bonus on Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks. Furthermore, the fob grants the wearer the Improved Initiative feat." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="isMPSorcMt" name="Staff of the Sorcerous Might" description="A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact had been sitting in a display case in the British National Museum for decades. No one knows exactly what caused it to release a lightning bolt, shattering the case along with any illusions that it was just an ordinary decorative walking stick. Some people say it belonged to Merlin, Circe, or any one of a dozen other literary or historical sorcerers. Others say that it is just another magical piece of detritus that has come through Shadow in recent years. No one truly knows whether it is one of a kind, or if there are other staffs like it waiting to be found. In any case, it is one of the most powerful items that any spellcaster could possess. \n\nUnlike a normal staff, a {I}staff of the Sorcerous Might{/i} holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don’t. A {I}staff of theSorcerous Might{/i} does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges.\n\n{B}The following powers do not use charges:{/b}\n• Detect magic\n• Hold portal\n• Light\n• Mage armor\n• Mage hand\n\n{B}The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:{/b}\n• Dimension door \n• Dispel magic\n• Electromagnetic pulse (Will save DC 17) \n• Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )\n• Ice storm\n• Invisibility\n• Knock\n• Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )\n• Monster summoning IX\n\n{b}These powers drain 2 charges per usage:{/B}\n• Cone of cold (10d6 points of cold damage, Reflex save DC 17\n• Passwall\n• Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum; Will DC 19 negates)\n\nA {I}staff of the Sorcerous Might{/i} gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.\n\n{B}DESTRUCTION{/b}\nA {I}staff of the Sorcerous Might{/i} can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take damage equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 23 Reflex save reduces damage by half.\n\nThe character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her (no saving throw)." compset="Staff">

  <thing id="facMPBkFth" name="The Black Feathers" description="The Black Feathers is a loose affiliation of organizations dedicated to fighting the spread of urban sprawl. Some groups are against deforestation, others are for the protection of wildlife, and still others simply pine for a simpler way of life, but all of them have at their heart a desire to see nature preserved.\nThe Black Feathers is an organization in only the loosest sense of the word. Many presume this is because of the logistical nightmare in getting different special interest groups to agree on agendas and action plans. However, it has just as much to do with the fact that the Black Feathers lends equal support to even the most violently radical groups (provided their goals are sufficiently anti-industrial). The organization does not, though, actively promote any of the agendas of its member groups. Rather, the Black Feathers provide logistical support and supply information to their members. They inform them of opportunities to promote their causes and keep them abreast of the actions of friend and foe alike. In fact, the thing that this organization does best is put like-minded individuals and groups together.\nVery little is known about the actual workings of the Black Feathers. It is unclear exactly how big the central organization is-even the most basic research reveals that the names found in press releases and public statements are false identities. Those who dig deeply enough, though, will find repeated references to an actual person named Black Feather. Although the mundane media considers her to be just another of the organization&apos;s fictional representatives, those familiar with Shadow culture can find out that Black Feather is an elf who has been in this world for the past 10 years or so.\nThe Black Feathers is a very accepting organization. They will have heroes as members so long as the heroes are actively promoting an ecological agenda. However, heroes should be aware that not all the Black Feathers&apos; member groups are especially scrupulous when it comes to public safety, in fact some are downright dangerous. But if the heroes don&apos;t much care what sorts of whackos they associate with, the Black Feathers can serve as a wealth of information and networking resources.\nIt is not possible to requisition any equipment from the Black Feathers themselves. But the organization almost always can point the heroes to someone who can fulfill their needs-for a price.\n\nPotions, Poultices, and Poisons\nThe Black Feathers is as loose an organization as one is likely to find. It is hard for members to call on timely aid from anyone other than their immediate compatriots. However, member groups are generally more than happy to share resources. Since the groups are universally devoted to ecological issues and organic lifestyles, they have spent a good deal of time perfecting recipes for various natural brews, cures, and irritants.\nMembers can send word through the grapevine that they need a particular known potion or poison, and their contacts will do their best to find a supply. This generally takes a while, and the requesting member must wait 1d6 days for any news.\nThe GM may make an immediate ruling on whether or not the requested item is available, or may choose to roll 2d6 and consult the following table. It is left to the GM to decide whether the item is given freely, the characters must pay the usual market price for the item, or the provider requires a higher than normal price (or perhaps some special service) in exchange for the item.\n\nRoll           Result\n2               Item unavailable\n3-5           1 dose of item available\n6-8           1d3 doses of item available\n9-11         1d6 doses of item available\n12             unlimited supply of item available" compset="Faction" summary="A loose affiliation of organizations dedicated to fighting the spread of urban sprawl.">

In response to a recent sudden increase in the number of reports being filed with police on such varied subjects as ghosts, UFOs, monstrous humanoids, and psychic episodes the United States Congress decided to take action. The Joint Committee on Homeland Security created a special commission to do in-depth fact finding.\n\nThe senators and representatives called into service one of the country&apos;s top experts on the exotic species, Dr. Astrid Kolgrim, to lead the Commission for Research into Unexplained Phenomena, usually just referred to as C.R.U.P. Through C.R.U.P., Dr. Kolgrim can commandeer personnel and materials from various government agencies including the FBI, Center for Disease Control, Office of Homeland Security, Immigration and Naturalization Services, and Internal Revenue Service among many others. She usually works with a small team of scientists and agents, but transfers them out every month or two so that she is the only truly permanent member of the Commission.\n\nSeveral government organizations (including the NSA and the Departments of Justice and the Interior) are opposed to C.R.U.P., or more correctly, they desire that Dr. Kolgrim be placed under their direct control rather than wandering around as a free agent. Meanwhile, C.R.U.P. goes on investigating all sorts of incidents related to Shadow. Dr. Kolgrim is able to recognize creatures of Shadow for what they are. Unfortunately, the Senators and Representatives for the most part are not. Still, they consider the information C.R.U.P. gathers to be useful, even if they feel differently about the conclusions the Commission draws.\nIt is certainly possible for heroes to be recruited as members of C.R.U.P., especially if they work for other branches of the government. However it is more likely for them to form a good working relationship with Dr. Kolgrim after their paths cross on different occasions. On the other hand, it is also possible that they might develop a personal antagonism with the doctor if things go badly.\n\nCommission Archives\n\nMembers of C.R.U.P. have access to the U.S. government files on all manner of unexplained phenomena, as well as hoaxes and attempts to defraud or hoodwink the American people. Any information gathered by the FBI, CIA, NSC, or other publicly-known branches of the government are open to their inspection. (At the GM&apos;s discretion, C.R.U.P. may not have access to files from Department- 7, the Paranormal Science and Investigation Agency, and other highly classified organizations.)\n\nMaking use of the archives provides a +4 equipment bonus on all Knowledge checks." compset="Faction" summary="Commission for Research into Unexplained Phenomena" uniqueness="unique">

Funding for the organization filters through a number of shell corporations, but research suggests that it all comes from a single benefactor. This person, however, has gone to great lengths (both mundane and magical) to ensure that the data trail becomes too confusing for even the most persistent investigator to follow.\n \nThe only person in the Department-7 infrastructure that the agents know of is Ms. Fellowes, a dark-haired, officious young woman with a slight British accent. Using arcane magic she occasionally projects her image or teleports necessary information and materials into a team’s base. She never, however, meets agents in person and no one knows where her office is located.\n \nDepartment-7 asks its operatives to investigate new expressions of Shadow, manage and maintain relationships between the mundane world and various enclaves of Shadowkind, and to deal with violent or destructive creatures of Shadow (or to protect benevolent creatures of Shadow from hostile mundanes). In the absence of an assigned task, agents are free to do whatever they like, but Department-7 demands that they maintain an appropriate public profile (in other words, that they not do anything that would break the trust that the organization has in either mundane or Shadow circles)." compset="Faction">

No one is really certain whether or not this was as prevalent on the other side of Shadow, but Shadowkind have adopted it since arriving in our world.\n \nThe Displaced is an umbrella organization that provides aid, assistance, and information to people and intelligent creatures from beyond Shadow—particularly during their difficult first few months of transition. They help their clients learn about their new environment, teach them the social customs, and introduce them to other Shadow creatures (as well as mundanes who are Shadow friendly).\n \nThe group has a significant budget, generated through donations and fundraisers. (Local governments and philanthropic organizations want nothing to do with the Displaced, whom they see as a group of fantasy and science fiction fans who like to pretend they are trolls and elves.) The group uses this money to sponsor halfway houses, free clinics, job placement services, and other community outreach programs.\n \nWhile the Displaced is an international organization, each local chapter functions autonomously. A large urban area may have as many as twenty or thirty chapters (one for each distinct neighborhood in the city), and they tend to work closely together. So no matter where a Shadow creature goes in the mundane world, he or she knows that the insignia of the displaced means a safe haven and a helping hand.\n \nIt is completely appropriate for heroes (particularly Shadowkind heroes) to belong to the Displaced. Even if they don’t belong, many parties will want to help this organization from time to time. Most of the Displaced’s money goes into their programs, so they do not have much left to spend on requisitioning equipment. Level checks for this purpose receive a –3 penalty. However, they will always volunteer to let heroes use any equipment at any of their facilities, as long as it is for a service that will aid the Shadow community.\n \nFriends of the Displaced\n \nMembers of the organization receive a small booklet containing the contact information for local organizations, companies, and individuals that have promised support of one kind or another. Each listing provides a name, address, phone number, email, and gives a short description of what sort of aid the a visitor can expect (as well as any caveats, exceptions, or rules of behavior that must be obeyed).\n \nEach city or region has its own version of the booklet, and Shadowkind who are new to an area must find the local central office of the Displaced in order to pick one up. Some offices make their booklets available online but, in deference to supporting businesses and individuals using mundane facades, it is usually necessary to get a printed version." compset="Faction">

Companies that exist merely because they own other companies span national, racial, and even magical borders. But none of them is as far reaching as Draco Industries. The CEO, Franz Draco, claims to trace his lineage back to a sultan from ancient Persia. This may just be a neat bit of PR (it fits with the man’s opulent lifestyle), but it certainly serves to put attention on the spectacle of the owner rather than the details of the company.\n \nDraco Industries has its figurative fingers in nearly every pie there is. Even the most cursory research reveals that it owns companies that manufacture everything from paper products to televisions to civilian and military aircraft. Also on the corporate roster are banks in a dozen different countries, private security providers, three internationally popular prepared food companies, two movie studios, a world-renowned think tank, and research firms in every scientific branch and discipline. It has contracts to produce weapons and vehicles for more than half the countries in NATO as well as mainland China, India, Pakistan, and South Africa. What research doesn’t usually reveal is that Draco Industries also owns several relatively large islands scattered throughout international waters. In other words, technically, Draco Industries is a country to itself.\n \nWith the breadth of activity in the corporation, it is difficult to see any overarching plan or goal other than continuing to grow by adding more and more business arms to the company. However, it is rumored that Franz Draco not only knows everything that his company does on a daily basis, but that he personally is responsible for all major decisions in every subsidiary and partnership. It is further said that he does so with a secret purpose in mind—that he is a bit mad and occasionally talks of “ruling the world.” But the world of international high finance is notoriously tolerant of eccentric multi-trillionaires.\n \nWhile it’s easy for heroes to work for a company owned by Draco Industries, it is extraordinarily unlikely that they can work for Draco himself. However, anyone who does get the man’s personal attention (or is working on a project in which he takes particular interest) can get up to a +15 modifier to level checks to requisition equipment." compset="Faction">

So many, in fact, that it is often difficult for him to find time to check in with even his most direct reports more frequently than once per month.

The symbol he decided on was a lead crystal paperweight in the form of a dragon egg—the egg being a symbol of life, growth, and potential for the future, and the dragon being a creature of power that dominates all around it.\n\nThe paperweights are hand-made exclusively by a crystal maker in eastern Europe. Each egg features swirls of air bubbles (often in the shape of a dragon or other mythical beast) in the center as well as intricate, acid-etched patterns on the skin. They refract light in pleasing patterns that play lightly over the walls and ceilings of the rooms in which they’re kept. In truth, though, these dragon eggs are more than simple decorations and tokens of esteem. They have all been enchanted to help Franz Draco keep tabs on the people closest to him.\n \nDraco owns a crystal dragon egg of his own, but his is four feet tall—it is the hub for all the other eggs. This great egg is enchanted so that it can cast detect thoughts spell centered on any of the other dragon eggs, no matter where in the world they are. Franz Draco is the only person who knows how to make the hub egg work. Draco has the egg brought with him wherever he goes." compset="Wondrous" stacking="merge">

They use global forums such as the WTO, World Bank, and WEF as covers to host their private meetings. In fact, the world at large is completely unaware of the Enlightenment&apos;s existence. One thing that sets the Enlightenment apart from other global cartels is its belief in supernatural abilities. The organization hires individuals with supernatural gifts from around the globe, and builds complex strategies based on the use of the powers of the supernatural.\n \nThe Enlightenment&apos;s ultimate goal is to create an industrious but content world population with a strong work ethic, who leave the elite to make the decisions (and reap the rewards). To the Enlightenment, money and power are the ultimate measure of a person&apos;s worth and can never reach a level of excess.\n \nAs an organization, the Enlightenment takes great pains to stay on the right side of international law. The last thing they want to do is draw attention to themselves, especially from self-styled heroes. However, individual members of the Enlightenment engage in their own bids for money and power-and some of them are less careful about their business. Heroes, particularly ones with connections to supernatural resources, may find themselves facing off against members of this elite organization.\n \nThe Enlightenment is not an organization that heroes should join, although heroes may often receive invitations and offers for employment. The Enlightenment sets policies more often than it takes any direct action (it is similar to OPEC in that it regulates what members do, but does not actually perform any functions itself). However, since members of the organization are supremely connected, anyone doing work for the Enlightenment can count on the ability to by restricted gear or equipment from any other Faction at the same cost in Prestige Points." compset="Faction">

There are oblique references to it throughout history. So how did our forefathers deal with this incursion from beyond reality? No one is completely certain, but there are rumors of a group known only as the Fellowship stretching back to the very first incursion.\n \nThe Fellowship is an ancient, secret organization dedicated to keeping track of and, when necessary, combating Shadow entities. No one is certain where the group is headquartered, where it gets its funding, or what if any ulterior motives it promotes. No one knows how to contact them, or where they get their information—but everyone knows that when the Fellowship shows up something terrible is on the verge of happening.\n \nAgents of the Fellowship invariably have freakishly detailed information regarding anyone and everyone they encounter. They always have a plan, a back-up plan, and an emergency plan and the equipment needed to carry out all three. And while they always fight to protect the world from unspeakable danger, Fellowship agents consider extensive collateral damage to neighborhoods, bystanders, and even allies to be “acceptable” in the pursuit of the greater good.\n \nThere are many even among the Shadow community who believe that the Fellowship is nothing more than a myth. But there are heroes everywhere who tell whispered tales of how representatives of the organization showed up on their doorsteps one day and pressed them into service on a particularly dangerous mission.\n \nHeroes will encounter agents of the Fellowship when and where they least expect it. And even though the organization will make use of their skills and abilities, the heroes will not actually become agents of the group. The Fellowship will usually offer to pay heroes for their efforts either in cash or by supplying equipment. They are more than willing to negotiate with the heroes, but will demand greater (often more frequent) service for more expensive or restricted materials. As a result, heroes do not requisition materials using the usual rules. Instead they “cut a deal” with a Fellowship agent. (GMs are encouraged to be agreeable bargainers—the Fellowship has a nearly endless supply of equipment—but to demand more and more future work out of the heroes.) The agent will supply the agreed upon materials in short order. Often he will have the requested items on his person, as though he knew ahead of time what the heroes would ask for. Heroes who attempt to renege on their agreement will receive one very firm warning from the Fellowship agent with whom they bargained. After that, if they continue to be deadbeats, the Fellowship simply considers them “expendable.” They will not hunt the hero down, but neither will they lift a finger to save the hero (or any of the hero’s allies) should they get in the way of Fellowship operations." compset="Faction">

  <thing id="facMPFOV" name="The Fraternal Order of Vigilance" description="There are any number of fraternal organizations maintaining local lodges and halls in cities, towns, and municipalities of all sizes. In the past few years the fastest growing lodge worldwide was the Fraternal Order of Vigilance, or the F.O.V. Founded on the precept of protecting its members and communities from the many threats that the modern world presents, the F.O.V. hosts seminars on selfdefense, sponsors finger-printing and other preventative child identification campaigns, and organizes neighborhood watch programs. Lodges are praised by local law enforcement, honored by other civic organizations, and quickly find places in the hearts of the communities in which they open.\n \nHowever, the truth of the matter is that the F.O.V. has a secret agenda. They are, in fact, an organization of mundanes who recognize Shadow creatures for what they are and are dedicated to wiping them from the earth. To the F.O.V. there is no difference between an elf, a troll, and a patch of green slime—they are all invaders from another place and they must all be eradicated. Local lodges subtly test members’ loyalties and beliefs until they are certain who they want to invite into their inner circle. But they are very careful to segregate their clandestine activities from their public persona—they want to avoid getting a reputation for being “monster hunters.”\n \nThe inner circle of a lodge spends evenings studying material on how to recognize and kill various Shadow creatures. And when they identify such a creature in their community, they begin moving against it. Their efforts are hampered by the fact that most mundanes perceive Shadow creatures as normal folk, so the F.O.V. must begin by isolating and disenfranchising them.\n \nThe inner circle starts by encouraging unsavory rumors about their targets, then moves on to producing falsified “proof” of immoral or illegal activities. Often they go so far as to plant illicit substances or materials in the Shadow creature’s home or otherwise frame them for a serious crime.\n \nIf the target decides to simply pick up stakes and move to another town, the F.O.V. sends operatives to waylay and kill them on the road. If the target sticks it out, chances are good he or she will end up spending at least some time in police custody—and once there the other prisoners are paid good money to make sure the Shadow creature doesn’t survive long enough to be released." compset="Faction">

In this modern world there are always new skills to learn and information to master. This is even truer since the recent rise of Shadow. Although most mundane folk do not recognize Shadow entities for what they are, some do and they are understandably curious.\n \nThe Institute for Continuous Education is dedicated to the premise that the more mundane folks understand at least the basic facts about magic, monsters, species from beyond Shadow, the better life will be for everyone. Classes are scheduled in convenient evening and weekend hours, and are taught by local experts in the field.\n \nThe classes offered by the Institute are bare bones basic. They mostly give mundane humans the vocabulary necessary to intelligently discuss creatures and effects of Shadow. However, if students stay with the program for several years, they eventually progress to the point of being able to cast spells, speak Shadow languages, and move relatively unobtrusively among creatures and species from other realms.\n \nThere is little of value for heroes in the Institute’s classes. But the instructors are often former-heroes or Shadow creatures and so make good contacts. They are usually in touch with various aspects of the local Shadow communities and make excellent sources of information." compset="Faction">

They often are as involved in politics as they are in work on the factory floor, but they do serve the goal of representing the rights and special needs of their members. Nowhere is that more necessary than for workers who happen to have come to the job from beyond Shadow.\n \nThe International Guild of Laborers is an organization that does collective bargaining, sets standards for safety and working conditions, and provides legal counsel for Shadowkind workers in almost every field imaginable.\n \nOddly enough, it is a rare instance when a mundane company takes particular advantage of a Shadowkind employee. Because the mundane managers do not perceive their workers as special in any way, they treat them no differently than native human workers. However, Shadow creatures who open their own businesses here on earth have a tendency to try to take undue advantage of their brethren’s natural (and supernatural) talents and abilities.\n \nThe I.G.L. also offers a job placement service for their members. People looking to hire workers of a particular species or with a particular set of abilities often come the Guild with their list of requirements.\n \nSo far, none of the labor issues in which the I.G.L. has been involved has come to all-out strikes (though temporary work stoppages have occasionally been applied). The Guild has a history of fairly representing their membership without ever making unreasonable demands on employers.\n \nAny shadowkind hero is welcome to join the International Guild of Laborers. This cost $100 once per year to pay the annual dues. The I.G.L. will not requisition any equipment for its members, but it does provide free legal service and various forms of advice and counseling." compset="Faction">

Over the centuries, they have invested wisely, spent frugally, and amassed an untold fortune that holds them in good stead even in today’s secular society. The organization has close ties to many of Europe’s royal families as well as good standing relationships with the heads of most major western religions. They seem to be a group that is universally respected and genuinely liked.\n \nThe Order is dedicated to collecting and preserving knowledge of paranormal abilities in otherwise mundane people. Because of this, many within the Shadow community refer to them as the “mystic monks,” but the brothers don’t seem to mind at all. In fact, they believe that this dismissive attitude makes it easier for them to go about their business of gathering and protecting dangerous information.\n \nThe Order owns the most exhaustive known collection of banned, suppressed, and otherwise anathema literature. It contains descriptions of and dissertations on every known mystical, magical, and otherwise unexplained phenomenon ever chronicled by mundane man. This collection is known as the Black Library, but it is not a library in the conventional sense. People, the Order believes, were not meant to know these secrets. It is important that the information be preserved in case it is needed to combat some great threat, but it is not meant to be used in a frivolous manner. Therefore, the Order has broken up the information into discreet, incomplete portions and given one portion to each of its monasteries to safeguard. In this way, the information is preserved, but none of their monks are ever tempted by too much knowledge. But each monastery is still a resource for information (albeit incomplete information) on the entire spectrum of paranormal abilities.\n \nAlthough the world considers them to be a bit eccentric, the monks of St. Bartholomew are a good lot, interested in the well being of all creatures.\n \nThe Order eschews worldly goods, so it is very difficult to convince them to requisition anything for anyone." compset="Faction">

This media conglomerate owns major newspapers in every major city in Europe and North America, runs fifteen different cable television networks, syndicates radio and network television programs in twenty different languages, and produces blockbuster movies from studios in Hollywood, Hong Kong, New Delhi, and Paris. And all that is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The company is also deeply involved in several major websites and online services, and employs dozens of software design houses to work on proprietary programs.\n \nOwned and managed by the international “Queen of the Media,” Anastasia Markova, Markova Enterprises plays a bigger part in many people’s lives than their own families do. Their stated goal is to give their audience “just what you want.” Detractors point out that this mission statement says nothing about production quality, intellectual or moral content, or even factual accuracy. But this does not seem to have hurt the company’s ratings (or stock value).\n \nMundanes see Anastasia Markova as a beautiful, dusky skinned, twenty-something jet setter, but anyone with knowledge of Shadowkind knows that she is in fact a drow who is at least 125 years old. Of course, that makes many suspicious of Anastasia’s motives and her company’s actions, but to this day M.E. Intl. has never been involved in anything even marginally illegal. It does, however, specialize in programming of exceptionally questionable taste.\n \nThe thing that really makes Markova Enterprises different from other media conglomerates, though, is the fact the its subsidiaries pay attention to Shadow culture. They do not report on such things to mundane audiences, but they do keep careful eyes on people, creatures, and events in Shadow communities. And reporters from M.E.-owned concerns can usually be found at the scene of any major Shadow-related incident. Heroes would be surprised to know exactly how much personal information on them is stored in the M.E. news morgue. It seems unlikely that any hero would be working directly for Anastasia Markova (who is attended mainly by other drow), but anyone with an occupation related to the media might well find themselves working for Markova Enterprises. In most respects, though, the organization is no different than any other media interest. It is only if a hero’s activities draw the eye of the Queen that things might become uncomfortable." compset="Faction">

The Paranormal Science and Investigation Agency (PSI for short) has been working behind the scenes for several decades.\n\nPSI&apos;s charter is to protect the country from supernatural threats both domestic and foreign. The Agency focuses mainly on paranormal threats. They are the organization that takes the lead in cases concerning the Mindwreckers, the Enlightenment, and the Silent Walkers.\nAgents of PSI do not seek outside aid unless they have no choice whatsoever. Their agency has been completely covert for decades, and they want to keep it that way. However, if they come across an individual who manifests paranormal abilities (or shows great potential to) they will approach him or her about joining the Agency.\n\nWhether PSI is an agency of highly trained mundane agents who deal with delusional groups that claim to paranormal powers, a group of spies who themselves are delusional about having supernatural powers, or are actual spellcrafters protecting the country from mystical terrorists depends entirely on the GM. Whatever the decision, the Paranormal Science and Investigation Agency can be a source of well-trained help when the heroes face opponents who pose serious threats to national security. \n\nAll investigative agents are taught that one of the best ways to stay safe in the field is to be sure that your target never sees you coming.

New storefronts are opening at a rate of about one every three days worldwide. The restaurants have become popular with children (both mundane and magical) because the restaurants feature arcades, medieval-themed costumed characters, puppet shows, and a twice-nightly duel where the Golden Knight roundly defeats the King of Pain. It’s all very commercialized (and extraordinarily trite), but it has struck a chord with the kids.

All of these items, it should be noted, are really just standard fast food fare with thematic names, and in every restaurant there hangs a plaque unequivocally stating that “no sentient beings were harmed in the making of this food.”\n \nInterestingly, the dining areas are designed to look like medieval taverns. Shadowkind and humans alike often come here just for the feeling of nostalgia it brings them, and many an adventure has started with a chance meeting in the dark corner of a Prancing Pony francise.\n \nThis organization offers nothing more than minimum-wage jobs (meals included)." compset="Faction">

Each MAGIC MEAL™ box contains either a temporary tattoo or a wind-up familiar.\n \nTemporary Tattoo: A wet transfer tattoo with a minor spell cast on it, this tattoo is labeled so parents know what their children are getting. The tattoo takes a move action to apply, and the effects last for 10 + 1d10 rounds. Each tattoo provides a +2 bonus on one of the following checks: Acrobatics, Climb, Perception, Stealth, or Swim.\n \nWind-Up Familiar: Toys in the shape of animals, each one has a spring wound motor enchanted so that it can follow a series of up to five simple directions. The toys recognize the following commands: Forward, Left, Right, Stop, Back, and Special. Each command results in 5 or 0 feet of movement—if the user fails to specify, the toy will move 5 feet. Any solid object weighing more than one pound stops a Wind-Up Familiar’s forward motion. Its feet will move, but it will not progress. It can still turn and move in another direction if that is a later part of its command string. Each command takes 1 move action to execute.\n \nEach toy has its own special ability, hence the command “Special.” They are: \n\nCat: eyes glow yellow lighting a 5 foot square in front of the toy; \n\nOwl: fly five feet straight up and five feet forward then fly straight down until landed;\n \nRat: pick up and carry one item weighing no more than one pound; \n\nSpider: climb solid surface as per the spider climb spell (including reduced movement rate);\n \nToad: hop five feet in the air, landing 10 feet forward. \n\nWind-Up Familiar: CR 1/2; Fine construct; HD 1/16 d10; hp 1; Init +0; Spd 5 ft.

On the surface it seems like nothing more than a group dedicated to a particularly strict martial arts form called Shizuka Ni Ugoku (&quot;Moving In Silence&quot;). Students are taught a rigorous code of honor that is derived from the samurai code of bushido, and dissent is not tolerated.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the Silent Walkers use their martial training, mental discipline, and philosophical beliefs to attempt to harness the hidden power of the human mind. They believe that through the perfection of mind, body, and spirit one can be granted the great honor and responsibility of mystical powers. Furthermore, they believe that anyone who achieves this end through any means other than their own is an affront before the gods.\n\nSilent Walkers oppose natural practitioners of the arcane, those who develop arcane powers using other methods, and rogue former members of this organization they collectively refer to as &quot;oni.&quot; The Silent Walkers believe it is their duty to hunt down and slay all oni. In recent years, they have toned down their stance on these matters. Although they still enforce them within the borders of Japan (much to the dismay of the Japanese government), the Silent Walkers have decided that practitioners of the arcane in the rest of the world are none of their concern. However, if a former member of their society flees the country, the Silent Walkers will spare no expense or effort to track him or her down. Once that happens, elite mystic assassins are dispatched to ensure that the oni does not teach any of the organization&apos;s secret techniques to unworthy outsiders.\n\nAnother difficulty has arisen in the wake of the recent influx of Shadow creatures. The word &quot;oni&quot; is most literally translated as &quot;demon&quot; or &quot;monster,&quot; and the goals and positions of the Silent Walkers have often been misinterpreted by some Shadowkind who think that the group wants to hunt them down for no good reason.\n\nThe Silent Walkers is a closed society. It almost never accepts members who are not Japanese, and certainly requires that all its members give up worldly goods and cares to devote themselves to the perfection of mind, body, and spirit. Members may not requisition any equipment, but the organization does provide all necessities for its members." compset="Faction">

The Swiss are an accepting people, and so they didn’t bat an eyelash at their new neighbors. For another thing, no fewer than four languages are spoken fluently in Zurich, and this gave the gnomes an advantage in dealing with people from all over the world.\n \nThese particular gnomes had been scholars and inventors in their lives on the other side of Shadow. They found that, advanced as the technology of the mundane world is, there were some important gaps—and ones that they were more than ready to fill. So they did what everyone in Zurich with an idea that will revolutionize the globe does: they incorporated and opened a consulting practice. Thus the Swiss Juncture of Gnomes was born.\n \nAlthough very few people were interested in their inventions (self-winding pasta, automated hat tippers, and instant mildew), it turned out that quite a few wanted the gnomes to focus their “outside the box” thinking on other problems. In recent years, the S.J.G. has developed natural disaster relief programs for third-world countries, done feasibility studies on building domed cities at the bottom of the sea, and designed a fully functional orbiting laser-cannon platform that (because of cost overruns) never actually got built.\n \nThe S.J.G. has opened offices in every major city worldwide, and do consulting work for most of the major financial institutions and political organizations in the western hemisphere. They charge a significant amount for their services, but their patrons invariably think it is worthwhile.

However, it has just as much to do with the fact that the Order of Life lends equal support to even the most violently radical groups (provided their goals are sufficiently anti-industrial). The organization does not, though, actively promote any of the agendas of its member groups. Rather, the Order of Life provides logistical support and supply information to their members.

Elemental energy causes the Crafter to be surrounded by wisps of the appropriate element. The exact manifestation varies and may be customized by the Crafter, but it is always present during any use of magic, and quickly fades when the Crafter ceases to draw power. These auras are primarily a visual, auditory or olfactory display, and never cause the Crafter or his environment any harm.\nUsing the Conduit Axiom requires the Verbal and Focus components for Spellcrafting.

The clone has the personality, memories, skills, and levels the original had at the time the piece of flesh was taken. However, the replacement must be at least one level lower than the original was at the time of death. If the original was 1st level, the clone&apos;s Constitution score drops by 1; if this would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the ritual incantation fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is at the level at which the original died.\nThe spell duplicates only the original&apos;s body and mind, not its equipment.\nA duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is somehow unavailable, but the resulting creature is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not somehow preserved.\nMaterial Component: The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies ($9000).\nFocus: Genetics laboratory ($35,000).\nSanity Check:  Will Save DC 22; failure results in one type of Insanity using the Insanity table available at: http://HLCommunit.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/mastery/sanityAndMadness.html#_sanity-and-madness\nFailure: Betrayal, and possibly reversal as well. If the caster and cloned creature were allies or neutral toward one another, then the cloned creature gains an alignment opposite the ones it once had. If the caster and cloned creature were enemies, then each one gains the Factions the other one had (although neither one knows the other has new Factions)." compset="Wondrous" holdable="no">

The new form can have no more Hit Dice than you or the subject has (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 Hit Dice. You can transform the subject into an average member of its own species. The new form cannot be an elemental, outsider, or undead unless the subject is that type already. The new form can&apos;t be incorporeal or gaseous.\n\nThe subject&apos;s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to the average scores for the new form. The subject doesn&apos;t gain or lose any hit points, regardless of its new Constitution score.\nThe subject retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The subject&apos;s class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The subject also retains all extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well as any spellcasting ability.\n\nYou can freely designate the new form&apos;s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form&apos;s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form&apos;s species. The subject is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form&apos;s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.\n\nThe subject acquires the physical qualities of the new form while retaining its own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, up to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying), darkvision and/or low-light vision, natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), species skill bonuses, species bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.\n\nThe subject also gains any extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form. You do not gain any extraordinary special qualities not listed above under physical qualities, such as blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, energy resistance, scent, or spell resistance.

The new form can have no more Hit Dice than you or the subject has (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 Hit Dice. You can transform the subject into an average member of its own species. The new form cannot be an elemental, outsider, or undead unless the subject is that type already. The new form can&apos;t be incorporeal or gaseous.\nThe subject&apos;s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to the average scores for the new form. The subject doesn&apos;t gain or lose any hit points, regardless of its new Constitution score.\nThe subject retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The subject&apos;s class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The subject also retains all extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well as any spellcasting ability.\nYou can freely designate the new form&apos;s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form&apos;s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form&apos;s species. The subject is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form&apos;s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.\nThe subject acquires the physical qualities of the new form while retaining its own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, up to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying), darkvision and/or low-light vision, natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), species skill bonuses, species bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.\nThe subject also gains any extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form. You do not gain any extraordinary special qualities not listed above under physical qualities, such as blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, energy resistance, scent, or spell resistance. You do not gain any supernatural abilities or spell-like abilities of the new form.\nIf the new form is capable of speech, the subject can communicate normally. Though the subject retains any spellcasting ability he had in his original form, the form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have humanlike hands to use somatic or material components.\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the subject&apos;s equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if the new form is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.

  <thing id="spMPASgAlg" name="Sigil of Algos" description="{b}Skill Check{/b}: Spellcraft DC 32, 6 successes\n{b}Sanity Check{/b}: Will Save DC 22\n{b}Failure{/b}: Two consecutive failed skill checks \n{b}Failure Effect{/b}: Reversal. The sigil affects anyone, including the caster and any bystanders, who looks at it or reads it. \n\nThis ritual incantation, named after the Greek god of pain, allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, the sigil of Algos causes one or more creatures within 60 feet of the rune (treat as a burst) to suffer wracking pain if they fail a Fortitude save. The pain imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. These effects last for 12 hours after the creature leaves the area of the spell.\nOnce triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 12 minutes. Any creature that enters the area while the sigil of Algos is active is subject to its effects, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need only save against the symbol once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. \nUntil it is triggered, the sigil of Algos is inactive (though visible and legible at a range of up to 60 feet). To be effective, a sigil of Algos must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders it ineffective (unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the sigil of Algos works normally).\nAs a default, a sigil of Algos is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a sigil of Algos can&apos;t trigger it (even if they meet one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading it). Once the ritual incantation is complete, the triggering conditions cannot be changed. \nIn this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a sigil of Algos to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. You can&apos;t use a sigil of Algos offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered rune remains untriggered if an item bearing the sigil of Algos is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a sigil of Algos cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a sigil of Algos can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or allegiances, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don&apos;t qualify. \nWhen scribing a sigil of Algos, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the rune. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&apos;s effects so long as the character remains within 60 feet of the sigil of Algos. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, he must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the sigil of Algos, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (up to ten creatures) extends the casting time by 1 hour. Attuning a large group (up to 25 creatures) takes one day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the GM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a sigil of Algos cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own sigils, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\nRead magic allows you to identify a sigil of Algos with a successful Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 16). Of course, if the sigil of Algos is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\nThe sigil of Algos can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. A clean spell has no effect on a sigil of Algos. Destruction of the surface where a sigil of Algos is inscribed destroys the rune but also triggers its effects.\n\n{b}Note{/b}: Magic traps such as sigil of Algos are hard to detect and disable. Characters can use the Perception skill to find a sigil of Algos and the Disable Device skill to thwart it. The DC in each case is 31." compset="Spell">

Any creature that enters the area while the sigil of Algos is active is subject to its effects, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need only save against the symbol once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. \nUntil it is triggered, the sigil of Algos is inactive (though visible and legible at a range of up to 60 feet). To be effective, a sigil of Algos must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders it ineffective (unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the sigil of Algos works normally).\nAs a default, a sigil of Algos is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a sigil of Algos can&apos;t trigger it (even if they meet one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading it). Once the ritual incantation is complete, the triggering conditions cannot be changed. \nIn this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a sigil of Algos to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. You can&apos;t use a sigil of Algos offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered rune remains untriggered if an item bearing the sigil of Algos is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a sigil of Algos cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a sigil of Algos can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or allegiances, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don&apos;t qualify. \nWhen scribing a sigil of Algos, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the rune. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&apos;s effects so long as the character remains within 60 feet of the sigil of Algos. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, he must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the sigil of Algos, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (up to ten creatures) extends the casting time by 1 hour. Attuning a large group (up to 25 creatures) takes one day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the GM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a sigil of Algos cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own sigils, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\nRead magic allows you to identify a sigil of Algos with a successful Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 16). Of course, if the sigil of Algos is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\nThe sigil of Algos can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. A clean spell has no effect on a sigil of Algos. Destruction of the surface where a sigil of Algos is inscribed destroys the rune but also triggers its effects.\nNote: Magic traps such as sigil of Algos are hard to detect and disable. Characters can use the Search skill to find a sigil of Algos and the Disable Device skill to thwart it. The DC in each case is 31.\nMaterial Component: Rare alchemical paints and herbs ($2000).\nSanity Check:  Will Save DC 22; failure results in one type of Insanity using the Insanity table available at: http://HLCommunit.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/mastery/sanityAndMadness.html#_sanity-and-madness\nFailure: Reversal.

It is useful against other Crafters as they are casting a spell of their own, upon active magical objects, or upon existing magical effects that need to be removed or suppressed. Any magic that is successfully targeted by a Dispel will end as if its duration had expired, or the magic can be suppressed for one minute per Caster Level. \n\nThe choice is up to the Dispelling Crafter but must be declared at the time of Crafting. This spell can be employed in one of two ways; a Targeted Dispel or a Counterspell.\nAs a Targeted Dispel, one object, creature or spell is the target of the Dispel. The Crafter makes one check (1d20 + Caster Level), and compares that to the spell with the highest opposing Caster Level (DC = 11 + the spell&apos;s Caster Level). If successful, the spell either ends or is suppressed. If unsuccessful, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest Caster Level. This process is repeated until the Crafter has dispelled one spell affecting the target, or has failed to dispel any spell. A Crafter may also use a Targeted Dispel to specifically end or suppress one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area. The specific spell effect must be named in order to be targeted this way. If the Crafter&apos;s Caster Level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it is affected. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if the check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\n\nIf an object is targeted by a Dispel, and it is a magical item, the Crafter makes a Dispel Check against the item&apos;s Caster Level (DC = 11 + the item&apos;s Caster Level). If this check succeeds, all the item&apos;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds per CL, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes non-magical for the duration of the effect. An inter-dimensional opening is temporarily closed. A magic item&apos;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magical tool is still a tool (a masterwork tool, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n\nCrafters automatically succeed on any Dispel Check against a spell that they cast themselves.\n\nWhen using a Dispel as a Counterspell, the target becomes an opposing Crafter as they attempt to cast a spell. The Crafter using the Dispel must hold his action in a ready state and when the opposing Crafter releases their spell, attempt to counter it with the Dispel. To determine the outcome, opposing Caster Level Checks are made. The Crafter with the higher result succeeds in his action.\n\nCantrip: The Crafter may use this Cantrip as described above, against any other Cantrip spell. Magical Items are unaffected by this Cantrip." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Cancel, counter, disrupt or suppress another spell or magical effect" uniqueness="unique">

The Crafter may also use this spell to ward an area against intrusion by setting up alarms and/or traps. Also, a creature or an area may be secured in a way that prevents extra-dimensional travel.\n\nThis spell, when cast upon a door, container or portal, magically locks it. The Crafter can freely pass his own Securing spell without affecting it. If the secured object has an actual mechanical or electronic lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while the lock remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful Dispel. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A Dispel will end the effects of a Securement spell, as normal.\n\nA Crafter can deploy this spell to ward an object or area by setting up a magical glyph that is triggered by the intrusion of certain predetermined creatures. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to an Axiom of belief, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. A glyph is hard to both detect and disable. An opponent can use the Perception skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + the glyph Crafter&apos;s Caster Level. There are two types of glyphs that can be employed in a Secure Spell; the Blast Glyph and the Spell Glyph.\n\nBlast Glyph: This glyph deals 1d4 points of damage per Caster Level to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him. The type of damage is chosen by the Crafter when the glyph is created. He can choose from acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic. Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.\n\nSpell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell that you know into a glyph. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on the Crafter&apos;s Caster Level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell requires a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving Throws and Spell Resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the Caster Level of the spell stored in the glyph.\n\nCantrip: The Crafter can place a special glyph upon a non-living object, known as an Arcane Mark. This glyph behaves like any other, but serves no purpose other than &quot;tagging&quot; an object. This mark can only be seen by the Crafter who created it, or through the use of a Detect spell.\n\nCybercrafting: A computing device can be secured with a mystic encryption passkey, adding a +10 to the DC of any attempt to gain access to either its operating system, or certain files within its memory. A ward may be installed also, that will release a virus into any computing device that attempts an unauthorized connection with the secured device, or upon an attempt to open a secured file." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Magically lock or seal an object or portal" uniqueness="unique">

This spell will heal 1d6 points of physical damage, or 1 point of temporary Ability damage, per Caster Level. If this spell is used on the undead, the effects are reversed, causing an equal amount of physical damage instead.\n\nAs an alternative to physical damage, this Conjuration can also remove one physical condition; such as Bleeding, Blinded, Dazed, Deafened, Exhausted, Fatigued, Nauseated, Paralyzed, Petrified, Shaken, Sickened &amp; Stunned. When attempting to remove one of these conditions, the Crafter must make a Caster Level Check (d20 + Caster Level), versus the DC of the condition affecting the target. The DC is set by the Caster Level of the Crafter, or total level of the creature, that caused the condition. If the target brought the condition upon himself through physical exertion or other means, then the target&apos;s Character Level sets the DC. (DC = 10 + Caster Level or Creature Level or Target&apos;s Character Level)\n\nAnother use of this Conjuration spell is to cure the effects of a poison or disease. Each poison and disease has its own set DC for Fortitude saves. The Crafter must succeed in a Caster Level check (d20 + Caster Level), against the DC of the poison or disease that is to be eliminated.  \nRegeneration &amp; Resurrection: These two very powerful aspects of the Heal spell can only be accomplished when the Crafter reaches Caster Level 10. The injured or deceased target must be laid prone (or some remains of the deceased that were part of it when it died). If the intention is to Regenerate a severed appendage (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even a head from a multi-headed creature), mend broken bones, or repair ruined organs, the Healer must continue until a number of hit points equal to half of the target&apos;s maximum have been healed, working at a rate of 1d6 per round. At the conclusion of the spell, the physical Regeneration is complete if the severed appendage is present and touching the target&apos;s body, otherwise the new appendage will grow back in 2d10 rounds. If the intention of the Healing is the Resurrection of the target, the corpse must not have been dead more than 1 year per Caster Level. The Crafter must continue working in the same fashion as before, until the full maximum of the target&apos;s Hit Points are restored. At the conclusion of the spell, the target is granted new life and is restored to full health. The target does gain 1 permanent negative level after being raised from the dead. A Crafter cannot Resurrect someone who has died naturally of old age. Constructs, Elementals, Outsiders and Undead creatures cannot be resurrected.\n\nCantrip: The Crafter may heal 1d2 points of physical damage with this Cantrip." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Use that raw energy to heal the wounds of the living" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPASCommu" name="Commune" description="School: Divination\nCasting Time: 1 Standard Action\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: Personal or Creature Touched\nTargets/Effects/Area: 1 Creature; See text\nDuration: 2 rounds per Caster Level\nSaving Throw: None\nSpell Resistance: No\n\nWith the Communion Spell, a Crafter can extend his perception and understanding to an extent that allows him to communicate with creatures or objects that he would normally not be able to converse with. The Crafter must identify and name a specific living creature type (humanoid, animal, aberration, etc.) or natural object type (stone, wood, plants, etc.). He will then cast the Communion Spell in the presence of that creature or object, and attempt to converse with his target. This spell does not ensure a friendly or cooperative relationship with the intended target, only the means to communicate. If the intended target of the Communion is a deity or extra-planar entity, the Crafter must perform this spell in the presence of an altar or totem dedicated to that deity or entity, or an object that was the personal possession of that entity. \n\nWhen a contact is established, the Crafter may ask 1 question, per Caster Level, of the target. The creature will answer to the best of its ability and knowledge, although wary and cunning creatures are likely to be terse and evasive. Less intelligent creatures may make inane comments that are only vaguely helpful at best. If the target is already friendly toward the Crafter, it may be asked to perform a favor or service. The option to perform the favor or service lies completely with the target, and may be ignored if not within the creature&apos;s best interests.\n\nThe ability conferred by a Communion Spell can be given to one creature that the Crafter touches, instead of the Crafter himself receiving the benefit. Regardless of who is using the Communion, if all questions are not asked within 2 rounds per Caster Level, the spell ends and the Communion is lost.\nAnother useful application of the Communion spell is to establish a mental bond between the Crafter and one or more willing targets, each of which must have an INT score of 3 or higher. Aside from himself, the Crafter may include 1 other creature for every 3 Caster Levels invested into the spell. Each creature included in the bond is linked to all the others, and creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another). If desired, the Crafter may exclude himself from the telepathic bond that is forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.\n\nCantrip: The Cantrip version of the Communion Spell will allow the Crafter to understand the spoken words of intelligent creatures, or read otherwise incomprehensible written languages. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The Cantrip enables the Crafter to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical.\n\nCybercrafting: A Crafter may name any electronic or mechanical device as the target of his Communion Spell. The Crafter may also establish a &quot;wireless&quot; mental bond with an appropriate number of computing devices, as outlined above." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Communicate with creatures that he would normally not be able to converse with" uniqueness="unique">

For inanimate objects, each additional round of study will provide a +1 on any skill that is used to deal with the subject.\n\nAura Strength: The strength of an aura is usually determined by a creature&apos;s Hit Dice.

A Crafter that employs an ESP spell can open a &quot;third eye&quot; within his own mind, allowing him to sense the thoughts and emotions of other creatures, and to see things as they truly are.\n\nA Crafter can use his heightened senses to &quot;listen&quot; to the surface thoughts of creatures within a 25&apos; radius per Caster Level of himself. The longer he listens, the more information he will gather.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher).\n2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than the Crafter&apos;s own Intelligence score), the Crafter is stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let the Crafter determine the location of the thinking minds if he can&apos;t see the creatures whose thoughts he is detecting.\n3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target&apos;s Willpower Save prevents the Crafter from reading its thoughts, and the Crafter must cast ESP again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (INT 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.\n\nInstead of listening, the Crafter may choose to establish a telepathic bond between himself and a number of willing creatures. The Crafter can bond with 1 other creature for every 3 CLs he has attained, and each of those creatures must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over a distance of 500 feet per CL. If desired, the Crafter may leave himself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.\n\nA Crafter can also perceive emotional responses from those under the scrutiny of an ESP spell. This use of the spell grants the Crafter a +20 bonus on any single attempt of a Sense Motive skill check during this spell&apos;s duration. This is especially useful in discerning falsehoods being spoken by the target.\nWhen a Crafter opens and views the world with his &quot;third eye&quot;, he can make an attempt to see things as they truly are, and see through any false images or magical transformations. When using this &quot;sight&quot;, the Crafter can attempt an opposed roll to recognize Illusions, Polymorphs or Shapechanges for what they truly are or what their true shape is. The Crafter rolls 1d20 + his CL against a DC of 10 + the CL of the effect altering his target.\n\nCantrip: A Crafter gains +5 to any single Sense Motive skill check.\n\nCybercrafting: The ESP spell can be used by a Cybercrafter to establish a telepathic bond with computing devices." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Awareness and perception into the realm of mental thoughts and emotions" uniqueness="unique">

A Crafter can also use this spell to sense the best direction to move in when searching for a creature, object or place.\n\nThe Foresight Spell can provide a Crafter with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 day per CL. The advice granted by this spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If the Crafter does not act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for correct information is 70% + 1% per caster level. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed.\n\nThe Crafter can use this spell to grant himself or 1 other creature a +20 insight bonus on their next attack or skill check roll. This bonus must be used within 1 round per CL, or it is lost. Alternatively, the Crafter may wish to hold the bonus provided by this spell, keeping it in a ready state for when it is needed. In this use of the Foresight Spell, the insight bonus is only equal to the Crafter&apos;s CL though it remains at the ready for 1 hour per CL. The bonus may be applied to any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Once the bonus is used, the spell ends. No one may have more than 1 of these effects upon them at any given time.\n\nAnother use of the Foresight Spell is to gain a sense of direction when searching for a creature, object or place. The target of the search must be within 400&apos; + 40&apos; per CL. The Crafter can sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized creature or object. He can search for general creatures or items, in which case he locates the nearest of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain creature or item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual target, the spell fails. The Crafter cannot specify a unique creature or item unless he has observed that particular target firsthand. Once the spell is successfully completed, the Crafter will turn in a circle until he feels an unmistakable tugging force that pulls him toward the target. After a duration of 1 minute per CL, this tugging force will cease.\n\nCantrip: A Crafter can use this spell to always know in which direction true north lies.\n\nCybercrafting: If this spell is cast through a GPS device when determining a direction toward a creature, object or place, the Crafter may extend the range of his search to 1 mile per CL." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Gain some insight into the near future" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPASScry" name="Scry" description="School: Divination\nCasting Time:  See Text\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: See Text\nTargets/Effects/Area: Magical Sensor\nDuration: 1 Minute per Caster Level\nSaving Throw: See Text\nSpell Resistance: See Text\n\nA Scrying Spell is used to view, listen to, or otherwise perceive an area or individual creature from a remote position. This can be done by extending the Crafter&apos;s senses to a distant location using an invisible magical sensor. A Crafter may scout an area close by, or remotely eavesdrop on a creature or place far away.\n\nWhen a Crafter wishes to Scry upon a specific location, the crafting of the spell requires 10 minutes to complete, after which a magical sensor appears in a desired locale no more than 1 mile per Caster Level away from the Crafter. The sensor allows the Crafter to either listen to, or view the area visually. The choice is up to the Crafter and is decided when crafting the spell. The chosen location must be known to the Crafter; either having personally been there, or studied it carefully. Once in place, the sensor does not move; although it can be rotated in all directions, allowing the Crafter to sense the surrounding area out to a range normal for him. There are no Saving Throws for this use of the Scry Spell, and Spell Resistance is not applicable.\n\nShould a Crafter choose to target an individual creature with a Scrying Spell, the time required to craft the sensor is 1 hour and the target is then granted a Willpower Saving Throw (DC = 10 + CL), to avoid the intrusion. The difficulty of the Saving Throw is modified by how much knowledge the Crafter has of the target, and what physical connection (if any) they have with one another. If the save fails, the Crafter can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. The range from the Crafter to his target may not exceed 1 mile per CL. If the save succeeds, the Crafter cannot attempt to Scry on that target again for at least 24 hours.\n\nAnother option a Crafter has when using this spell is to send his magical sensor out into his surrounding area, as a sort of scout. Crafting the sensor takes 1 minute, requires no Saving Throw and is not affected by Spell Resistance. Once ready, the sensor travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as the Crafter would (primarily looking at the floor); or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The sensor sees exactly as the Crafter would see if he were there. The sensor can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The sensor cannot enter another plane of existence, even through an open Translocation portal. The Crafter must concentrate to use a Scrying sensor. If he does not concentrate, the sensor is inert until he again concentrates. The sensor has no maximum range.\n\nCantrip: As a Cantrip, this spell will produce a sensor that remains just above the Crafter&apos;s shoulder, and allows the Crafter to view what is directly behind him. The sensor has vision equal to the Crafter.\n\nCybercrafting: A Crafter may substitute his magical sensor in lieu of using a known camera or microphone within the spell&apos;s range. If employing this technology, the Crafter may use the equipment&apos;s normal range for sight or hearing." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Perceive an area or individual creature from a remote position" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="arMPACyphr" name="Cypher Crafter" description="The Axiom associated with this Archetype deals with a mystic theorem that dates back to the Babylonians, Greeks and Egyptians; but is known to the modern world as Numerology. A Cypher has come to be known as describing any decimal number, or string of numbers used in a secret code. The magical use of a Cypher breaks down a spell&apos;s formulae into long patterns of seemingly unrelated numbers. To the initiated, the right pattern of numbers can unlock wondrous insights to the mysteries of the cosmos, and even to the secrets of harnessing mystical energy. Only a Crafter that is trained in this Axiom can have any hope of decoding these number patterns.\nWith the rise in popularity of personal computing devices, and especially of the internet, many Cypher-Crafters have discovered the secrets of encoding magical formulae into binary numbers. This has given birth to a truly new and modern form of Spellcrafting, known as &quot;Cybercrafting&quot;. The Cypher Archetype enjoys an advantage because of this discovery, in that many of the Cypher-Crafter&apos;s spells can also effect modern mechanical or electronic equipment in astonishing ways. The special uses of Cybercrafting are noted in each applicable spell&apos;s description. \nAnother unique aspect to this Axiom is the need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Cypher-Crafter must write out the coded formula for each of his known spells, and have them on hand, in order to cast them. This is akin to the reading of a scroll, although the spell is not destroyed or erased after such castings. If the Crafter is employing this Axiom as Cybercrafting, the &quot;spell program&quot; must be loaded into a computing device and held ready to be executed.\nThe Cypher Axiom requires the Material component, which usually consists of nothing more than paper and pen. Also required is the Focus component, which is usually a computing device and is needed for any spells that interact directly with mechanical or electronic equipment." compset="ClassVary" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="arMPAIntrn" name="Intrinsic Crafter" description="The theory of this Archetype&apos;s Axiom states that magical power is drawn from the Crafter&apos;s own personal energy stores. This personal energy was referred to in ancient cultures as the Qi, Prana, or Energeia. Modern philosophers commonly refer to this energy source as a human&apos;s &quot;life force&quot;, or his immortal soul. The hidden truth is that the human soul consists of pure mystical energy, and though it is immortal, it is not infinite in its power. A soul can be burned out, and what is left will never again know the touch of magic. \nBecause this energy is from the Crafter&apos;s own personal store, it is more physically demanding than the other Axioms. When crafting a spell and making the consequent Fortitude check afterward, the Intrinsic Crafter suffers a +1 to the save DC. An Intrinsic Crafter suffers twice as long as other Crafters when enduring the conditions caused by a failed Fortitude Save. \nThe Intrinsic Axiom requires only the Verbal and Somatic components for Spellcrafting, unless specifically stated otherwise in a spell description." compset="ClassVary" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="arMPARitul" name="Ritual Crafter" description="Spellcrafters with this Archetype practice their magic with methodical patience, adhering to minute details in sequential repetition. Rituals are the orderly and practiced ceremonies that slowly gather ambient magical energy into the building of a spell. A ritual often begins with a magical circle, within which sanctified items, tools and offerings are arranged in detailed order, often times on an altar. In many rituals a chant is recited; carefully choreographed words and/or movements all designed to gather and focus the latent magical energy that permeates the environment. \nOnly one person can lead a ritual, although any number of individuals may lend support to the casting and they need not be trained in its procedures. The ritual is performed with a Caster Level equal to the Ritual leader&apos;s character level. Each individual that contributes to the ritual will aid in the Spellcrafting skill check by +2, and increase the Caster Level of the spell by +1. When the Ritual is complete, all participants must make a Fortitude Saving Throw as normal for any Spellcrafting.\nCrafting a Ritual requires a considerable amount of extra time compared to other Axioms. The Casting Times for a Ritual-Crafter are measured in whole rounds instead of actions, and they require 1 round per Caster Level of the spell.\nRituals require the Verbal and/or Somatic components, as well as Material components necessary for the specific ritual." compset="ClassVary" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="arMPASpirt" name="Spirit Crafter" description="As stated before, human souls (and those of most humanoid creatures), are made up of pure mystical energy. When a person&apos;s mortal body expires, for whatever reason, their soul is released and seeks to transcend to one of the Outer Planes where their personal belief of eternity awaits. Moral implications aside, there are often circumstances that prevent or delay this transcendence. When this happens, the immortal soul becomes a shade, or ghost, that wanders the Spirit Realm mirroring our own world as a Transitive Plane. A Crafter that is trained in this Archetype&apos;s Axiom may contact this Spirit Realm of ghosts, and draw from the collective mystical energy of their souls in order to power his spells.\nThe danger in dealing with departed souls is dire. A Spirit-Crafter must always take caution when drawing power from the Spirit Realm, for these undead creatures are often extremely vengeful toward the living. Whenever a Crafter uses the Spirit Axiom to craft a spell, should his required Fortitude Saving Throw be a critical failure (natural d20 roll of 1), he will suffer from a Corrupting Touch (Pathfinder Bestiary - Ghost), with damage equal to 1d6 per CL of the spell he was attempting. An additional Fortitude Save, if successful, will reduce the damage by half.\nThe Spirit Axiom requires the Verbal and Somatic components for Spellcrafting. Using a Focus item that once belonged to an undead spirit will add a +2 bonus to any Spellcraft Skill check when dealing with that specific spirit." compset="ClassVary" uniqueness="unique">

The affected creature can be given simple suggestions or outright commands, and it will be compelled to follow them to the best of its abilities and to the exclusion of all other actions. This is a telepathic link between the Crafter and the target creature, with no verbal requirements beyond necessary components of the spell&apos;s crafting.\n\nThe Crafter can target only one creature, and the duration of an Influence spell begins when the Crafter ceases to concentrate upon the affected creature. While concentration is maintained, commands may be given and completed and new commands issued. Once concentration ceases the Influenced activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. The Crafter may instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.\n\nThe affected creature will resist this control, and any target forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Self-destructive orders give the affected creature a +10 to its Saving Throw. A very reasonable suggestion causes the Saving Throw to be made with a -2 penalty. The affected creature receives a new Saving Throw when each new command is given.\n\nOnce control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the Crafter and the affected creature are on the same plane.

The first form is that of a wall, measuring 10&apos; squared per Caster Level. The exact dimensions of the wall are up to the Crafter and his needs, but must be a continuous, immobile structure with no breaks. A wall will remain in place for as long as the Crafter concentrates upon it, if it is not destroyed first. Once the Crafter ceases to maintain the wall, it will dissolve after 1 round per Caster Level. \n\nThe second form of a Barrier spell is that of an aura. This is an energy sheath that surrounds the Crafter or a single touched creature, and deals out its effects to all those that close to within normal melee range. An aura will move with the Crafter and has a flat Duration of 1 round per Caster Level.\nThe form and effects of a Barrier Evocation depend upon the energy type it is made of.\n\nAir: As a Wall only, the barrier will deflect small &amp; tiny flying creatures. Reflex saves are made to hold onto items 1lb or less. Normal missiles have a 30% chance of deflection + 5%/CL. Gasses &amp; gaseous forms cannot pass, although incorporeal creatures are not affected.\n\nChaos: As an Aura only, Lawful &amp; Neutral creatures take 1d6/CL damage &amp; are Staggered 1d4 rounds. Counters &amp; countered by any Law Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nCold: As a Wall, this barrier forms a sheet of Ice 1&quot; thick/2 CLs. Each 10&apos; section of ice has 3 HP &amp; Hardness 2 per inch of thickness. To breakthrough in a single attack requires a Strength check with a DC 15+CL. As an Aura, Frigid air deals 1d6+1/CL &amp; Fatigues opponents who fail Fortitude save.\n\nDarkness: As an Aura only, within the Barrier bright light becomes normal, normal light becomes dim, and dim light becomes darkness. If already dark, within the aura becomes supernaturally dark, blocking even Darkvision. At each 3 Caster Levels, one step may be skipped to the next (CL 6 may go from bright to dark). Counters &amp; countered by any Light Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nEarth: As a Wall only, tectonic energy erupts, sending dirt &amp; rock upward to form a wall 1&quot; thick/3 CLs. Each 10&apos; section of earth has 5 HP &amp; Hardness 5 per inch of thickness. To breakthrough in single attack, a Strength check of DC 20+CL is required.\n\nElectricity: As an Aura only, electric shock deals 1d6+1/CL &amp; Staggers opponents for 1d6 rounds that fail a Reflex save.\n\nEvil: As an Aura only, Good &amp; Neutral creatures take 1d6/CL damage &amp; are Staggered 1d4 rounds. Counters &amp; countered by any Good Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nFire: As a Wall, choose one side of the Barrier to emit intense heat that deals 2d4 to all within 10&apos;, and 1d4 to all between 10&apos;-20&apos;. Deals 2d6+1/CL damage to all who pass through &amp; they Catch Fire. As an Aura, flames deal 1d6+1/CL &amp; opponents who fail a Reflex save Catch Fire.\n\nForce: As a Wall, magical force forms an invisible Barrier 1&quot; thick that blocks all attacks from both sides but is damaged normally. Gaze attacks are effective through the wall, and the entire Barrier has 10 HP/CL &amp; Hardness 5/CL. The Barrier is immune to Dispel, although an Alter spell of higher Caster Level will instantly destroy the Wall. As an Aura, the Barrier acts as a personal force field (or prison), with the same properties as the wall.\n\nGood: As an Aura only, Evil &amp; Neutral creatures take 1d6/CL damage &amp; Staggered 1d4 rounds. Counters &amp; countered by any Evil Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nLaw: As an Aura Only, Chaotic &amp; Neutral creatures take 1d6/CL damage &amp; Staggered 1d4 rounds.

The Crafter must be able to see the target area and determine the range (distance and height), before launching the sphere. The bomb will detonate upon reaching its target, unless striking an intervening material body or solid barrier along its trajectory. An early impact results in an early detonation. If the Crafter attempts to send the sphere through a narrow passage, such as through an open window or the gap in a wall or fence, he must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack (AC 10 +1/10&apos; range), or else the bomb strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.\n\nWhen the Evocation Bomb detonates, its energy blossoms out, filling a 20&apos; area, and all creatures and objects within this area take 1d6 damage per CL in addition to the energy&apos;s unique effects. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bomb&apos;s effects may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.\n\nThe Crafter can refrain from firing the bomb after crafting the spell, if he wishes. This is treated as a touch spell for which the Crafter is holding the charge.\n\nThe Crafter can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per Caster Level, at the end of which time the Evocation Bomb detonates, centered on the Crafter (who receives no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the bomb in a later round is a standard action.\nDifferent energy types provide additional effects.\n\nAir: All creatures within the Bomb&apos;s blast area suffer the effects of an Improved Bull Rush. The blast deals double damage against creatures in gaseous form. No effect on incorporeal creatures.\n\nChaos: Against Lawful &amp; Neutral creatures, the blast deals double. Against all others, the damage is only half.\n\nCold: All creatures within the bomb&apos;s blast area suffer the effects of the Fatigued condition. A target that is already fatigued is not affected. If the Bomb strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 1&quot; in a 5&apos; radius. The freezing radius expands by another 1&quot; and 5&apos; per 2 CLs. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level.\n\nDarkness: In the area of detonation, tiny motes of darkness snuff out all sources of non-magical light (light bulb filaments will be blown, fires smaller than a campfire will be extinguished, chemical lights will dilute and lose all illumination). The motes will counter any Light Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nEarth: The Bomb&apos;s blast area is filled with streaking dirt and stone particles, creating a zone of shrapnel. All creatures within the area of effect suffer an additional +1 damage per CL, and 1 target creature per 3 CLs will be coated with the dirt and stone particles, becoming Pinned for 1 round.\n\nElectricity: All creatures within the bomb&apos;s blast area suffer the effects of the Staggered condition. All electronic equipment within the area that is not insulated will overload and shut down as if affected by an Electromagnetic Pulse. Any computer, telephone, television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media are scrambled. The pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not everything that uses electricity. Lights will stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Combustion engines continue to run, although without any electronic support. Most cars manufactured after the 1980s won&apos;t start after a pulse because they have electronic ignition systems.\n\nEvil: Against Good &amp; Neutral creatures, the blast deals double. Against all others, the damage is only half.\n\nFire: This Evocation Bomb creates the classic fireball, generating a searing explosion of flames that detonates with a low roar. The explosion creates almost no pressure, but the bomb causes creatures and objects in the area to Catch Fire, and it can melt metals with low melting points.\n\nForce: When this bomb detonates, it has full effect on incorporeal and ethereal creatures.\n\nGood: Against Evil &amp; Neutral creatures, the blast deals double. Against all others, the damage is only half.\n\nLaw: Against Chaotic &amp; Neutral creatures, the blast deals double. Against all others, the damage is only half.\n\nLight: This Evocation Bomb causes a sphere of searing radiance to explode silently within the target area. All creatures caught in the blast are subject to the Blinded condition for 1 round per CL. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals double damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes, and to creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural. \n\nSonic: Upon detonation, this bomb fills the target area with a tremendous cacophony. All creatures within the blast area suffer the Deafened condition. \nCreatures that cannot hear are not subject to this condition, but are still damaged." compset="CustomSpec" summary="A ranged attack to detonate within a target area" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPASConst" name="Construct" description="School: Evocation\nCasting Time:  1 Standard Action\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: See text\nTargets/Effects/Area: See Text\nDuration: See Text\nSaving Throw: Reflex half &amp; no condition\nSpell Resistance: Yes (to all except Ice, Earth, &amp; Force)\n\nA Construct Evocation spell shapes an energy type into a tangible object. The most common Construct that Crafters shape is that of a melee weapon, typically a sword, made entirely of a specific energy type. There are numerous objects and shapes for Crafters to imitate when designing a Construct, the only limit being that it must be a simple design; no complex mechanisms may be mimicked as a Construct.  Specific energy types add additional effects to the Constructs.\n\nAs stated, one of the more common Constructs is that of a simple melee weapon composed of energy. The Threat Range and Critical Multiplier are the same as the weapon imitated, and Martial or Exotic weapons may be imitated in form, but any special attacks that are signature to those weapons require proper training (proficiency). Regardless of the form the weapon takes, all strikes made with it are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8 +1 per 2 CLs, and Strength bonuses do not apply. The Crafter receives a bonus to hit with this weapon equal to half his Caster Level. This type of Construct&apos;s duration is 1 minute per CL, but should it ever leave the Crafter&apos;s hand it will dissolve away at the end of that round. \n\nAnother Construct that is popular with Evokers is the animated forms of creatures or objects. These forms are made of a specific energy type, and often take the shape of animals, humanoids, or even abstract objects. No matter the form, these Constructs are limited in size dependent upon the Crafter&apos;s Caster Level. Beginning with Tiny at CL 1, the Crafter may shape a Construct one size category larger at every fifth Caster Level attained (1-5 Tiny; 6-10 Small; 11-15 Medium; 16-20 Large). Construct forms may move away from the Crafter up to a range of 25&apos; +5&apos; per CL, and may be directed to attack a single 5&apos; square. Directing these Constructs requires the Crafter&apos;s focus and concentration, and he may take no other actions other than a movement so long as the Construct form is active. The Construct&apos;s attack damage is 1d6 per size category +1 per CL, and it has an AC of 11 +1 per CL and HP equal to its Crafter at full health.\n\nDifferent energy types provide additional effects.\n\nAir: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can perform the effect of an Improved Bull Rush. All attacks deal double damage against creatures in gaseous form. No effect on incorporeal creatures.\n\nChaos: Against Lawful &amp; Neutral creatures, all attacks increase Threat Range by 3 (17-20) and Critical Multiplier by 1 (x3).\n\nCold: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can inflict the Fatigued condition upon a successfully struck target, for 1 round per CL. A target that is already fatigued is not affected any further.\n\nDarkness: The weapon or energy form gains a bonus to attacks and damage when wielded in less than normal light levels. In dim light, the bonus is +1 per 3 CLs; in darkness the bonus is +1 per 2 CLs. If able to operate in supernatural darkness, the bonus increases to +1 per CL.\n\nEarth: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can perform the effects of the Cleave Feat.\n\nElectricity: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can inflict the Staggered condition upon a successfully struck target, for 1 round per CL. A target that is already staggered is not affected any further.\n\nEvil: Against Good &amp; Neutral creatures, all attacks increase Threat Range by 3 (17-20) and Critical Multiplier by 1 (x3).\n\nFire: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can cause a successfully struck target to Catch on Fire, with the appropriate saving throws and effects applying.\n\nForce: Weapons and energy forms have full effect on incorporeal and ethereal creatures. The construct is also immune to Dispel, although an Alter spell of higher CL will instantly destroy it.\n\nGood: Against Evil &amp; Neutral creatures, all attacks increase Threat Range by 3 (17-20) and Critical Multiplier by 1 (x3).\n\nLaw: Against Chaotic &amp; Neutral creatures, all attacks increase Threat Range by 3 (17-20) and Critical Multiplier by 1 (x3).\n\nLight: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can produce the effects of Brilliant Energy, ignoring non-living matter and negating any armor or shield bonuses of the target. While performing this action, the weapon or energy form cannot harm undead, normal constructs, or objects.\n\nSonic: Once per CL, the weapon or energy form can inflict the Deafened condition upon a successfully struck target, for 1 round per CL. A target that is already deafened is not affected any further.\n\nOne other, unique application of the Construct spell is the Contingency. When a Crafter reaches Caster Level 11, he may employ the energy of magical force to weave a matrix pattern that will serve to store the energy for a separate spell. The Crafter then creates a companion spell that is &quot;hung&quot; within the framework of the matrix. This woven pattern of invisible magic is then worn like an item of clothing or jewelry, waiting for a trigger event specified by the Crafter during the spell&apos;s creation. The Contingency Construct and the companion spell are cast at the same time, requiring 10 minutes to craft both; if the companion spell has a crafting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. The companion spell must be one that the Crafter knows and affects him personally, and it may have no more than one-third of the Crafter&apos;s Caster Level invested into its strength. Also, crafting both the Contingency Construct and the companion spell require the expenditure of 2 Hero Points. The conditions needed to bring the companion spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the Contingency Construct immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being &quot;cast&quot; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. A Crafter can use only one Contingency Construct spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled. A Contingency Construct has a Duration of 1 day per Caster Level, or until it is discharged; the companion spell&apos;s Duration is suspended while held by the matrix. Upon duration&apos;s end or discharge, the Contingency Construct dissolves away (along with any companion spell still held within)." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Shapes an energy type into a tangible object" uniqueness="unique">

By controlling a specific energy type, the Crafter can change the environment in his immediate area in ways unique to the energy being employed. All creatures and objects within the affected area are subject to the effects of the Field spell. A successful Reflex save allows a creature to escape the area before suffering any effects.\n\nA Crafter may influence the environment around him in a 20&apos; radius, gaining an additional 5&apos; per Caster Level. The exact nature of the influence is dependent upon the specific energy type used. If the same energy type is being controlled by another Evoker, then a Caster Level check will determine whose influence will dominate the area. No matter which energy type is utilized, the Crafter that creates the Field is immune to all of its effects.\n\nAir: This Evocation Field allows a Crafter to control the energy of moving air, and to alter the strength of the wind within the area by 1 step per 3 CLs. A listing and explanation of wind speeds and effects can be found in the Pathfinder Core Rules, chapter 13. \n\nChaos: The spell imbues the area with Chaos energy. All chaotic creatures within the area gain a +1 per 2 CLs morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and spell DCs that result from Chaos Evocation. All Lawful and Neutral creatures suffer a -1 per 2 CLs penalty on the same. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to a chaotic deity or higher power, the modifiers given are doubled. No creatures of Law or Neutrality may be summoned to an area of Chaos.\n\nCold: When this Field is created, the temperature within the area is instantly reduced to 40 degrees (if not already this cold), and is further reduced by an additional 5 degrees per 2 CLs. All creatures other than the Crafter that are unprotected against cold conditions must make Fortitude saves according to the rules for Cold Dangers in the Pathfinder Core Rules, chapter 13.\n\nDarkness: Within the Evocation Field, bright light becomes normal, normal light becomes dim, and dim light becomes darkness. If already dark, the area becomes supernaturally dark, blocking even Darkvision. At each 3 CLs, one step may be skipped to the next (CL 6 may go from bright to dark). This spell counters &amp; is countered by any Light Evocation, CL check to determine.\n\nEarth: This spell manipulates the tectonic energy within the area of the Field, causing the ground to become unstable as if by a tremor or earthquake. Each creature standing in the area must make a Reflex save at DC 10 +1 per 2 CLs, or fall down Prone. Any structure standing on open ground takes 5 points of damage per CL. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects is normally resolved. Unlike other Evocation Fields, the Earth Field has a duration of only 1 round.\n\nElectricity: An Electric Field creates an area of supercharged particles. All creatures within the field suffer from an interruption of their natural bio-electric rhythms. If a Reflex save fails to avoid the effects of the spell, the creature is Staggered for the duration of the Evocation Field. All electronic equipment within the area that is not insulated will overload and shut down as if affected by an EMP.\n\nEvil: The spell imbues the area with Evil energy. All evil creatures within the area gain a +1 per 2 CLs morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and spell DCs that result from Evil Evocation. All Good and Neutral creatures suffer a -1 per 2 CLs penalty on the same. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to an evil deity or higher power, the modifiers given are doubled. No creatures of Good or Neutrality may be summoned to an area of Evil.\n\nFire: When this Field is created, the temperature within the area is instantly raised to 90 degrees (if not already this hot), and is further raised by an additional 5 degrees per 2 CLs. All creatures other than the Crafter that are unprotected against heat conditions must make Fortitude saves according to the rules for Heat Dangers in the Pathfinder Core Rules, chapter 13.\n\nForce: This Evocation Field creates an area of distorted probability. All creatures within the Field (including incorporeal and ethereal creatures), that attempt an attack on the Crafter must roll two d20 dice and take the less favorable result. This applies also to any Spellcrafting skill checks that occur within the Field.\n\nGood: The spell imbues the area with Good energy. All good creatures within the area gain a +1 per 2 CLs morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and spell DCs that result from Good Evocation. All Evil and Neutral creatures suffer a -1 per 2 CLs penalty on the same. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to a good deity or higher power, the modifiers given are doubled. No creatures of Evil or Neutrality may be summoned to an area of Good.\n\nLaw: The spell imbues the area with Law energy. All lawful creatures within the area gain a +1 per 2 CLs morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and spell DCs that result from Law Evocation. All Chaotic and Neutral creatures suffer a -1 per 2 CLs penalty on the same. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to a lawful deity or higher power, the modifiers given are doubled. No creatures of Chaos or Neutrality may be summoned to an area of Law.\n\nLight: The area within this Evocation Field fills with an instantaneous flash of intense ultraviolet light. All creatures within the area are subject to being Blinded. After the flash, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all creatures within the field. The affected creatures shed light equal to a candle, and suffer a -20 penalty to all Stealth skill checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, Glamer, or similar effects. The outlining glow can be any color, according to the Crafter&apos;s choice at the time of crafting. The glow does not cause any harm to the creatures thus outlined.\n\nSonic: The Crafter fills an area with intense &quot;white noise&quot;, effectively making any sounds made within the area to be directionless and muffled. No verbal communication can be overheard from outside the Field, and all radio transmissions traveling into or out of the Field are garbled and rendered useless." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Directly manipulate the area around him" uniqueness="unique">

This spell creates a false sensation, and those who experience it perceive the same thing, not their own slightly different versions of the event. It is not a personalized mental impression, and it cannot make something seem to be something else.\n\nA Figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the Crafter has a Performance skill that allows for such imitation. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language the Crafter can speak. If he tries to duplicate a language he cannot speak, the Figment produces gibberish. Likewise, the Crafter cannot make a visual copy of something unless he knows what it looks like, or can Perform its movement (or copy another sense exactly unless he has experienced it).\n\nAt Caster Level 1, this spell creates the visual Illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by the Crafter. The Figment does not include sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The Crafter can move the Figment within the limits of the size of the effect. At Caster Level 3, the Crafter may include some minor sounds but not understandable speech. At Caster Level 5, sound, smell, and thermal effects are included in the Figment. At Caster Level 9, the Crafter no longer needs to maintain concentration on the Figment, as it will follow a script determined by the Crafter. The Figment can also include intelligible speech if the Crafter wishes. At Caster Level 11, the Figment can be made permanent. By concentrating, the Crafter can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static otherwise. A permanent Figment can also be programmed to a trigger event, and is otherwise dormant.\n\nIf a Figment is used to create the Illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, it appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the Figment is used to hide traps or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight, work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the Figment to disappear. Although the Crafter can see through his own Illusions, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will save (but they do learn that it is not real). Electronic detectors and probes are not fooled by magical Illusions (motion detectors, range finders, GPS locators, etc.), although any creature viewing an Illusion via video monitor will be. \n\nCantrip: The Crafter can create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. The Crafter chooses the type of sound, and cannot thereafter change the sound&apos;s basic character. The volume of the sound can go as high as one human voice shouting, and this Cantrip can be used to enhance Figments of lower Caster Level." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Classic effect that most people imagine when they think about an Illusion" uniqueness="unique">

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes too. If the Crafter cast the spell on someone else, neither he nor anyone else can see the subject, unless they have the means to see Invisible things. Items dropped or put down by an Invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pockets worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes Invisible, although the source of the light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable. If a check is required, a stationary Invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. This Glamer spell ends if the subject attacks any creature, including any Spellcrafting that targets a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. At Caster Level 5, the Crafter can confer Invisibility upon all creatures within 10&apos; who are present at the time of the Crafting. Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but those moving into the area after the Crafting, do not become Invisible. Affected creatures, other than the Crafter, who attack negate the Invisibility only for themselves. The area is mobile with the Crafter or recipient of the spell. At Caster Level 7, the Crafter can produce an Invisibility spell that does not end when an attack is made.\n\nAnother use for a Glamer Illusion is to cause a touched creature&apos;s outline to appear blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment from attacks. The concealment gained is 10% per Caster Level. This does not prevent opponents from targeting the subject normally, and a properly directed Detect spell will see through the Glamer.\n\nA Crafter can use a Glamer Illusion to make himself, including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment, look different. The Crafter can make himself seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. He cannot change his creature type, but otherwise the extent of the apparent change is up to the Crafter. He could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person or gender. If used to make a disguise, this Glamer provides a +10 bonus to the skill check. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, however. At Caster Level 9, the Crafter may use this Glamer on other creatures.\n\nA Glamer Illusion can be used to mask, suppress, or divert the information gained by a Divination spell. This becomes a contested action, as the Diviner and the Illusionist make Caster Level checks to determine whose spell overcomes. If the Illusionist is successful, he may choose the results of the Divination spell as he wishes. \n\nA Crafter may use the Glamer Illusion to silence an area within a 20&apos; radius. All sound is stopped; conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be crafted, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. Spells can be set to a stationary area, or upon a mobile object or creature. A successful Willpower save will negate the effect.\n\nCantrip: A Glamer Cantrip can be used to add a bonus of +5 to any single Stealth skill check." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else" uniqueness="unique">

All Pattern Illusions are mind-affecting spells.\nWhen used as an attack, the Crafter can create a vivid 20&apos; cone of clashing colors to spring forth from his hands in an instantaneous flash, causing creatures to become Stunned, perhaps also Blinded, and possibly knocking them Unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD., although sightless creatures are unaffected. \n2 HD or less: The creature is Unconscious, Blinded, and Stunned for 2d4 rounds, then Blinded and Stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then Stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked Unconscious.)\n3 or 4 HD: The creature is Blinded and Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then Stunned for 1 round.\n5 or more HD: The creature is Stunned for 1 round.\n\nAnother, more passive use of the Pattern Illusion, is to create a twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors that weave through the air in a 20&apos; radius; Fascinating creatures within it. The Crafter can affect up to 5 HD of creatures per Caster Level, although sightless creatures are immune. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell&apos;s point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails it&apos;s Willpower save is Fascinated by the pattern. \n\nWith a simple gesture (a free action), the Crafter can make the Pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All Fascinated creatures follow the moving pattern of lights, trying to remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the Pattern still try to follow it. If the Pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each Fascinated creature gets a second Willpower save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked, creatures that can&apos;t see them are no longer affected. The Crafter can maintain the pattern of lights for a number of rounds equal to his Caster Level, but must concentrate on it throughout.\n\nCantrip: As a Cantrip, a Pattern Illusion can produce a brief multi-colored flash that will Dazzle a creature for 1 round." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Creates an image that others can see" uniqueness="unique">

This impression is totally in the minds of the targets. It is a personalized mental impression, all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see. Third parties viewing or studying the scene don&apos;t notice the Phantasm. All Phantasms are mind-affecting spells.\n\nA simple but useful Phantasm is the use of an Illusory Script, where a Crafter writes instructions or other information on any suitable writing material, and only the person (or people) designated by the Crafter at the time of the Spellcrafting can read the writing; it&apos;s unintelligible to any other creature. Up to 5 people per Caster Level may be named as authorized readers of the script. Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a Willpower Saving Throw. A successful save means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature triggers an implanted Influence spell. The Influence lasts for 30 minutes, and is limited to such suggestions as, &quot;Close the book and leave,&quot; &quot;Forget the existence of this note,&quot; and so forth.\n\nAnother, more insidious use of the Phantasm spell, is the method for entering another creature&apos;s dreams. The distance between the Crafter and the subject may be no greater than 1 mile per Caster Level. It takes 1 minute to Craft this Phantasm.  As a benign application, the Crafter sends a message to another creature in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, The Crafter must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The Crafter then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient&apos;s dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the Crafter gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. The duration of the spell is the time required for the Crafter to enter the recipient&apos;s dream and deliver the message. As a malicious intrusion, the Crafter may send a hideous and unsettling nightmare to the dream of another creature. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d4 points of damage +1 per Caster Level. The nightmare leaves the subject Fatigued and unable to regain Hero Points for the next 24 hours. \n\nThe difficulty of the Willpower Saving Throw depends on the Crafter&apos;s knowledge of the target and the physical connection (if any) he has to that creature.\n\nThe Crafter must enter a trance in order to contact a creature&apos;s dream, and he is not aware of his surroundings or the activities around him while in the trance. The Crafter is defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (He will always fail Reflex and Will saving throws). Creatures that don&apos;t sleep or don&apos;t dream cannot be contacted by this spell.\n\nThe signature use of the Phantasm Illusion is the dreaded Phantasmal Killer. The Crafter creates a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target simply by forming the fears of the target&apos;s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell&apos;s target can see the Phantasmal Killer; the Crafter sees only a vague shape. The target first gets a Willpower Saving Throw to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the Phantasm touches the target, and the target must succeed on a Fortitude Saving Throw or suffer cardiac arrest from the fright, and fall into the condition of Dying. Even if the Fort save is successful, the subject takes 2d6 +1/CL points of damage.\n\nCantrip: A Phantasmal insect may be sent against a target, causing a -4 penalty to concentration checks, and 1 point of damage from an illusory sting or bite." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Creates a mental image that only the target of the spell can perceive" uniqueness="unique">

Such Illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a Shadow Illusion is real.\n\nThe greatest aspect of a Shadow Illusion is the use of material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions that mimic the Conjuration spells Create and Summon, as well as any of the Evocation spells. For every 3 Caster Levels of the Crafter, the equivalent power level of these Shadow versions is 1 Caster Level, and even then, their potency depends upon the target&apos;s Willpower Saving Throw to disbelieve the effects. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Those that fail the save, and thus believe the Shadow spell, take full effect and damage. Creatures that succeed in the Will save disbelieve the Shadow spell, and will suffer only 20% of the spell&apos;s damage, and any other effects have only a 20% chance of occurring. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any Saving Throw (or Spell Resistance) that the spell being simulated allows. A summoned Shadow creature has 20% of the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it&apos;s recognized as Shadow). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a Shadow creature, however, the Shadow creature&apos;s damage is only 20% of normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. Furthermore, the shadow creature&apos;s AC bonuses are just one-fifth as large. A creature that succeeds on its save sees the Shadow Illusions as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.\n\nThe Crafter may also use material from the Plane of Shadow to create a projected image of himself; a quasi-real, illusory version of the Crafter. The projected image mimics the Crafter&apos;s actions (including speech) unless it is directed to act differently (which is a move action). The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like its creator, but is intangible. At Caster Level 5, the Crafter can see through the image&apos;s eyes and hear through its ears as if he were standing where it is, and during his turn the Crafter can switch from using the image&apos;s senses to using his own, or back again, as a free action. While he is using the senses of the projected image, the Crafter&apos;s body is considered Blinded and Deafened. At Caster Level 10, the Crafter may choose that any spell he can craft, whose range is touch or greater, can originate from the projected image instead of from himself. The projected image can&apos;t cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image. Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save. The Crafter must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If his line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends.\n\nCantrip: A Shadow Cantrip can duplicate the Cantrip of any Evocation spell, or of the Summon and Create spells, with all the restrictions as detailed above." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Ceates something that is partially real from extra-dimensional energy" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPASDeath" name="Death" description="School: Necromancy\nCasting Time:  1 Standard Action\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: Touch\nTargets/Effects/Area: A single touched creature (or corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nSaving Throw: None (See Text)\nSpell Resistance: No\n\nPerhaps the quintessential aspect of Necromancy is the ability to direct and control the flow of energy from the Negative Material Plane, into the corpse of a deceased creature. With the Death spell, a Crafter can control the actions of an undead creature, and can even create his own undead minions. \n\nThe Crafter first learns to control undead creatures, starting with those that are mindless and non-intelligent. These undead creatures get no saving throw against the Death spell. When controlling a mindless being, the Crafter can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;come here,&quot; &quot;go there,&quot; &quot;fight,&quot; &quot;stand still,&quot; and so on. Non-intelligent undead won&apos;t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders. At Caster Level 3, the Crafter may attempt to control more advanced types of undead creatures. If the subject is intelligent, it perceives the Crafter&apos;s words and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly), and it will not attack while the spell persists. The Crafter can give the subject orders, but he must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&apos;t ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. When a Crafter reaches Caster Level 13, he no longer needs to win an opposed Charisma check; his control is absolute. Intelligent undead creatures remember that they were controlled however, and they may seek revenge after the spell&apos;s effects end.\n\nWhen creating an undead creature, the Crafter infuses a dead body with energy from the Negative Material Plane. The types of undead the Crafter can create are based on his Caster Level.\n\nSkeletons and Zombies can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed, and they are the only undead that remain under the Crafter&apos;s control indefinitely, but only as many as 4 HD per Caster Level. A destroyed Skeleton or Zombie can&apos;t be animated again. Intelligent undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If the Crafter is capable of commanding undead, he may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms. The Crafter may create less powerful undead than his Caster Level would allow, if he chooses.\n\nThe Death spell may be used to grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. The corpse receives a Willpower Saving Throw to resist the spell as if it were alive. If successful, the corpse can refuse to answer any questions or attempt to deceive the Crafter, using Bluff. The Crafter may ask one question, plus an additional question per two caster levels, though the corpse&apos;s knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed the Crafter in life. The soul can only speak about what it knew in life; it cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death. The Crafter can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond, having at least a mouth to speak. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.\n\nOne other useful application of the Death spell is the Crafter&apos;s ability to preserve the remains of a dead creature so that it does not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead using the Heal spell. The Crafter may preserve a dead creature for 1 day per Caster Level, and the days spent under the influence of this spell don&apos;t count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant. The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.\n\nCantrip: Using this version of the Death spell, the Crafter can determine the condition of a single creature near death within the spell&apos;s range. The Crafter instantly knows whether the creature is dead, dying, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct)." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Control the flow of energy from the Neg Material Plane, into the corpse of a deceased creature" uniqueness="unique">

With this spell, the Crafter&apos;s soul my transcend its physical vessel and travel around as an incorporeal entity, either in part or as a whole. The Crafter may even attempt to supplant another humanoid creature&apos;s soul with his own, effectively performing a &quot;body swap&quot;.\n\nIn the most basic use of this spell, the Crafter calls forth a ghostly hand shaped from his life force to materialize and move as desired, allowing the Crafter to deliver low-powered, touch range spells at a distance of 100&apos; +10&apos;/CL.

The hand is Incorporeal, and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons.

  <thing id="cMPASAlter" name="Alter" description="School: Transmutation\nCasting Time:  1 Standard Action (See Text)\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: Close (25&apos; + 5&apos; per Caster Level)\nTargets/Effects/Area: See Text\nDuration: See Text\nSaving Throw: See Text\nSpell Resistance: See Text\n\nAn Alter spell uses Transmutation magic to fundamentally change a non-living object or substance. The effects for this spell vary a great deal, as it has numerous applications. An Alter spell can rearrange, mask, mark, imbue, or change the temperature in the physical makeup of an object.\n\nA Crafter using this spell can convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Living creatures and magic items cannot be created, and the quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used. With a casting time equal to 1 round for each unit produced, the Crafter can fabricate 1 cubic foot of finished product per Caster Level, although if he works with a mineral, the product is reduced to 1 cubic inch per level. At Caster Level 9, the Crafter increases his fabrication output to 10 cubic feet &amp; 1 cubic foot per Caster Level. An appropriate Craft skill check is required for any product with any degree of detail or complexity (to include electronic or computing equipment, mechanical devices, firearms, etc.). Also with the Alter spell, a Crafter can mend and repair any non-living item. The Crafter may repair 1d6 Hit Points per CL to an object or construct. If the object has the Broken condition, this is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original Hit Points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this aspect of the spell to function. In contrast to this, the Crafter may also attempt to cause this condition. If the item fails a Fortitude Saving Throw, it gains the Broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is destroyed on a failed save. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but the Crafter must have a Caster Level equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but it does not restore their magic abilities unless the Crafter is more than twice the Caster Level of the item&apos;s creator. Items with charges and single-use items cannot be repaired in this way.\n\nThe Alter spell is also useful in masking physical evidence. The Crafter can remove all natural and unnatural odors from an object or creature for up to 1 hour per Caster Level. The affected target cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. Another way to mask physical evidence is to remove all tracks and signs of movement through an area. This effectively renders normal tracking impossible. The Crafter can also alter the contents of a worded page so that it appears to read something entirely different. The text of any spell can be changed to show that of any other spell of equal or lower level known by the Crafter. Alter cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide the words on a scroll. All of these masking techniques have a Duration of 1 hour per Caster Level.\n\nA Crafter can use the Alter spell to mark, brand or tag a non-living object with any sort of symbol, logo or short message. The Crafter must touch the target object, and the spell makes an indelible mark of no more than 6 characters per 2 CLs, onto the object, inflicting 1d4 points of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the object, and can be hidden with a wrapping of any sort or by scrapping it away, although if the damage is healed, the mark returns for a Duration of 1 day per Caster Level. At Caster Level 7, the mark can be made permanent despite any damage being healed.\n\nAnother application of the Alter spell is to raise or lower the temperature within an object. Unattended, normal objects receive no Saving Throw. Magical items are allowed a Saving Throw, and items that are in a creature&apos;s possession use that creature&apos;s Saving Throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled, and fire damage if it is heated; if it is wearing or wielding the item. On the first round of the spell, the object becomes either chilly or warm and becomes uncomfortable to touch, though it deals no damage. On the second and following rounds, the spell deals a cumulative 1d4 points of either cold or fire damage, for a number of rounds equal to the Crafter&apos;s Caster Level +1. Any temperature effect intense enough to damage the creature will negate the damage from this spell, if they are in opposition, on a point-for-point basis. This form of the Alter spell may also counter another&apos;s if the effects are in opposition.\n\nCantrip: An Alter Cantrip may be used to heal 1 Hit Point of damage to any non-living item. \nPermanency: As a specialized form of the Alter spell, a Crafter that has reached Caster Level 9 can make certain spell effects permanent. The Crafter must first know and Craft the desired spell, and then follow it with this Alter spell. Regardless of the Crafter&apos;s Archetype, the Permanency Alter spell requires the material component of diamond dust as part of its Spellcrafting. Any spell effect that has a Duration longer than instantaneous, and that does not cause any form of direct harm or influence over any living creature, can be made permanent. The spell being made permanent can be crafted at any Caster Level desired, and once set; it may never be changed from that CL. The amount of diamond dust required for the Spellcrafting is valued at $10,000 per Caster Level the spell will be set at.\n\nDisintegrate: By far, the most devastating use of the Alter spell is the ability to completely render any target to dust. This is the only aspect of the Alter spell that will affect a living creature, and it cannot be used until the Crafter reaches CL 11. The Crafter chooses a target and a thin, green ray springs from his pointing finger. The Crafter must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per Caster Level. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer Hit Points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature&apos;s equipment is unaffected. When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10&apos; cube of non-living matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Force Barrier. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated. The ray affects only one target per casting." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Fundamentally change a non-living object or substance" uniqueness="unique">

It can even imbue an object with a semblance of life, to the extent of limited autonomy. At its basic level, this spell allows a Crafter to animate a nonliving rope-like object (to include electrical cords, metal cables, garden hoses, etc.). The maximum length is 50&apos; +5&apos;/CL, and the possible commands that a Crafter can give it are; &quot;coil&quot; (form a neat, coiled stack), &quot;coil and knot,&quot; &quot;loop,&quot; &quot;loop and knot,&quot; &quot;tie and knot,&quot; and the opposites of all of the those (&quot;uncoil,&quot; and so forth). The Crafter can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it (it does not snake outward), so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical, and the spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature. As he gains more magical prowess, the Crafter can start to animate other non-living objects. Each such animated object can be given a basic and rudimentary task (as in basic dog commands), or can be directed to immediately attack whomever or whatever the Crafter initially designates. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. \n\nThe Crafter may animate one Tiny object per Caster Level, starting at Caster Level 5, or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Small object counts as two Tiny objects, A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four Small objects, a Huge object as eight Small objects, a Gargantuan object as 16 Small objects, and a Colossal object as 32 Small objects. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature. See the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for the statistics of animated objects. At Caster Level 13, the Crafter can begin to Animate plants. Use the statistics for animated objects, except that a plant smaller than Large does not have a Hardness rating.\n\nAnother aspect of the Animate spell is to simply move an object through Telekinesis. The Crafter must concentrate and take no other actions save a movement, and then he points his finger at an object weighing no more than 10 lbs. per Caster Level, and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, the Crafter can propel the object as far as 20&apos; per round in any direction, out to a maximum range of 400&apos; +40&apos;/CL. Using this type of animating force, the Crafter can be so gentle as to open and close a door, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, or other container. The spell can even be used to unlatch a mechanical lock, granting a +20 to any Open Lock skill check. The Animate spell can be a broad force as well, moving earth to create wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography. The area to be affected determines the casting time; for every 50&apos; square, the Crafting takes 5 minutes. The maximum area that can be affected is 50&apos; square per Caster Level. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging, and this spell has no effect on earth creatures.\n\nCantrip: The Animate Cantrip can move an object weighing no more than 5 lbs. to a maximum distance of 25&apos;." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Give movement to inanimate objects that normally would have no movement" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cMPASEnhan" name="Enhance" description="School: Transmutation\nCasting Time:  1 Standard Action (See Text)\nComponents: as per Archetype\nRange: Touch\nTargets/Effects/Area: 1 or more Creatures or Items (See Text)\nDuration: 1 minute per Caster Level \nSaving Throw: Will negates\nSpell Resistance: Yes\n\nWhen a Crafter employs the Enhance Transmutation, he infuses a creature or item with magic in an attempt to augment a certain characteristic. Nearly everything about a creature can be enhanced; abilities, skill performance, attack and defense bonuses, movement capabilities, and even perception.\nThe Crafter can grant a bonus to one ability score, making a creature stronger, more agile, heartier, smarter, wiser, or more charming. The bonus provided is +2 at Caster Level 1, which increases to a bonus of +4 at Caster Level 5, and then again to a +6 at Caster Level 10. All of the usual benefits of a higher ability score temporarily apply with this enhancement. At Caster Level 11, the Crafter may apply a +2 bonus to 1 creature per Caster Level, all of whom must be within 30&apos; of one another. This bonus increases to +4 at Caster Level 15, and finally to +6 at Caster Level 20. Should a creature refuse the Enhancement, a successful Willpower Saving Throw will negate the effect.\n\nAnother creature aspect that can benefit from the Enhance spell is Skill performance. The Crafter can grant a +5 competence bonus to a single skill check made by the target creature. This bonus increases to +10 at caster Level 7, and at Caster Level 14 the bonus is +15. The skill to be enhanced and the creature performing it must be named during the Crafting of the spell, and the creature then has 1 minute per Caster Level to benefit from the bonus. \nThe Enhance spell may be used to give one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the target creature a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls per 4 Caster Levels (to a maximum of +5). The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike&apos;s damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage. This enhancement can also be applied to any non-magical weapon. The bonus counts as magical for the purposes of penetrating DR.\n\nWhen this spell is used for defense bonuses, it toughens a creature&apos;s skin and enhances its natural Armor Class by +1 per 4 Caster Levels (to a maximum of +5). The enhancement bonus provided by the Enhance spell stacks with the target&apos;s natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0. This enhancement can also be applied to non-magical armor.\nThe most dramatic use of the Enhance spell may lie with its application to specialized forms of movement. The Crafter may grant one of the following movements to a single touched creature or to himself.\n\nBlink: The target creature moves quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and looks as though they&apos;re winking in and out of reality at random. Physical attacks against the subject have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn&apos;t help opponents. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). This use of the Enhance spell has a Duration of 1 round per Caster Level.\nEthereal Travel: At Caster Level 11, the Crafter can become ethereal, along with his equipment. For the Duration of 1 round per CL, the Crafter is in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, the Crafter can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. At Caster Level 17, the Crafter may bring along 1 additional creature per 3 CLs who are all linked by hands, into the Ethereal Plane with him.\n\nFly: At Caster Level 5, a target creature can fly at a speed of 60&apos; (or 40&apos; if it carries a medium or heavy load). The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using the Enhance spell to fly requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.\n\nGlide: The Crafter may only use this Enhance spell on himself, and while affected, he takes no damage from falls. In addition, the Crafter can move up to 5&apos; in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot he falls, at a speed of 60&apos; per round. He cannot use this spell to actually gain height, merely coast in other directions as he falls. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes the Crafter to rise, he can take advantage of it in order to increase the distance he can glide. If wearing a wing-suit, the Crafter gains a +5 to his Fly skill checks.\n\nHaste: The Transmuted subjects, 1 per 3 CLs, move and act more quickly than normal. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature&apos;s full Base Attack Bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on Attack rolls and a +1 Dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes him lose his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes the subject lose his dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature&apos;s modes of movement increase by 30&apos;, to a maximum of twice the subject&apos;s normal speed using that form of movement. Multiple haste effects don&apos;t stack.\n\nJump: The subject gains a +10 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics skill checks made to attempt high jumps or long jumps. The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at Caster Level 5, and to +30 (the maximum) at Caster Level 9.\n\nSpider Climb: The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20&apos; and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). The subject retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.\n\nThe Enhance spell can be used to sharpen a target creature&apos;s senses. The subject gains a +2 competence bonus per Caster Level on Perception checks and gains low-light vision. Subjects that have low-light vision double the distance they can see under the effects of this spell. At Caster Level 3, the subject gains the ability to see 60&apos; even in total darkness. This darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight.\n\nCantrip: The Crafter can offer a +1 enhancement to a single d20 roll made by a single creature." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Infuses a creature or item with magic" uniqueness="unique">

A Polymorph can never target the Crafter personally; it is used to change others. The subject is allowed a Fortitude Saving Throw if it chooses to resist the Polymorph. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gets an automatic Saving Throw whether the change is voluntary or not, at a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, and the subject still resists, it must also make a Willpower Saving Throw. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to craft spells (if it had the ability), and gains the Alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its Class and Level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as Base Attack Bonus, base save bonuses, and Hit Points). It retains any class features (other than Spellcrafting), that aren&apos;t extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. If the transformation is voluntary and/or willingly accepted, the creature may retain all of its original abilities and faculties. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to Polymorph, and a creature with the Shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action. A Polymorph spell&apos;s effects have a Duration of 1 minute per Caster Level, although at CL 13, the effects become permanent until affected by another form-altering effect. \nWhen the Crafter chooses the form of the Polymorph spell; Humanoid, Animal, Magical Beast, Elemental, Giant, Plant, or Dragon, he affects the subject according to his Caster Level as follows. The Crafter may always choose any form of a lower CL if he so chooses, while retaining the strength of his maximum CL." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Transform a living creature into a form of the Crafter&apos;s choosing" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rmMPASCMGh" name="Ghost (minion)" description="When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil—even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife.\n\nMore than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue—there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover—after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost&apos;s abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts.\n\nWhen a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal &quot;copies&quot; of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature&apos;s possession). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality.\n\nThe original items remain behind, just as the ghost&apos;s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item&apos;s use)." compset="Race">
