  <thing id="cSGBombard" name="Bombard" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Alchemist 4, Explosive Missile, Infusion \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or onehanded firearm bullet held by an adjacent ally with the power of his bomb. The ammunition retains this power for 1 round/level, or until discharged. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate but is still considered discharged." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cSGDyeBomb" name="Dye Bomb" description="{b}Benefit{/b}: All creatures that take damage from a dye bomb, or fail a saving throw against it, are marked with a brightly-colored dye (or a color selected by the alchemist when the bomb is thrown). Washing has no effect for the first 72 hours (though magic can erase the dye), but it fades completely after 2 weeks. A creature marked by a dye bomb takes a -10 penalty to Stealth checks (and the DC to track it with Survival is reduced by 10) for a number of rounds after exposure equal to the alchemist’s level." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cSGElmntlB" name="Elemental Bomb" description="{b}Prerequisites{b}: Alchemist 4, one of the following discoveries: acid bomb, concussive bomb, frost bomb, or shock bomb \n\n{b}Benefit{b}: The alchemist can cause any bomb that would normally deal fire damage to instead deal acid, cold, electricity, or shock damage. To use this ability to deal acid damage, the alchemist must have the acid bomb discovery. To use it to deal cold damage, the alchemist must have frost bomb discovery. To use it to deal electricity damage, the alchemist must have the shock bomb discovery. To use it to deal sonic damage, the alchemist must have the concussive bomb discovery. \n\nThe alchemist cannot use this discovery with the acid bomb, concussive bomb, frost bomb, force bomb, or shock bomb discoveries. The alchemist can, however, combine it with other bomb modifying discoveries, allowing him to create an elemental breath weapon bomb that deals cold damage, or a stink bomb that deals sonic damage, rather than all  the alchemist’s bombs using a discovery marked with an *asterisk being restricted to dealing fire damage." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

A gas bomb may either deal nonlethal damage, or no hit point damage, selected by the alchemist when the bomb is thrown. A gas bomb retains any other effect (such as a smoke bomb’s fog cloud effect, or a stink bomb’s stinking cloud effect)." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

Creatures in the area  may make Reflex saves (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier) to reduce the duration of the glittering effect to 1 round. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed, and continues to sparkle until it fades.

Creatures exposed to the bomb’s smoke area must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +1/2 alchemist level + alchemist Int bonus) or burst into laughter as if affected by a {i}hideous laughter{/i} spell. Unlike {i}hideous laughter{/i}, a creature affected by this bomb may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect every round as a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Targets of a different creature type than the alchemist do not gain a +4 bonus to their saving throws against laughing gas bombs, unlike {i}hideous laughter{/i}. This is a mind-affecting, poison effect." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cSGRmtDtnt" name="Remote Detonator" description="{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Alchemist 10, delayed bomb (APG) \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When the alchemist creates a delayed bomb, rather than choosing in advance how many rounds after the bomb is released it goes off, the alchemist may detonate the bomb as a move action. The alchemist must either be connected to the bomb (such as by a fuse, rope, cord, or wire), or have line of sight to the bomb to detonate it. Another creature moving the physical connection to a remote detonated bomb also sets off the bomb. A delayed bomb set  with a remote detonator can last up to ten minutes per alchemist level without being detonated before becoming inert. It still counts against the alchemist’s limit of one active delayed bomb at a time. In all other regards it acts as a delayed bomb." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">
