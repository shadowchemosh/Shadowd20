  <thing id="ipuHellInf" name="Hellfire Infusion" description=" This bubbling red liquid is stored within a glass and iron syringe of diabolical craftsmanship that is warm to the touch. When injected into a living creature (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), the fiery liquid surges through the subject's veins, filling it with hellish ferocity and an outwardly fiendish appearance. While under the effects of a hellfire infusion, the subject creature gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. Its skin turns crimson, its eyes change to burnished yellow, and short horns sprout from its head. By all appearances, the subject transforms into a fiendish creature, although the alteration is only superficial. These effects last for 50 minutes.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nRequirements Brew Potion, alter self, heroism; Cost 950 gp" compset="OilPotion">
