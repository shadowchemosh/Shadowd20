After he came to your aid, however, you never saw nor heard from him again, leaving you with a sense of unending anticipation that each day might be the day you were asked to return the favor. Yet that day never came, and your fears and anxiety about what the professor would call on you to do abated. Assuming the old man had either forgotten about you or died, you eventually assumed you&apos;d never have to follow through on your end of the bargain. When you received word of the professor&apos;s death, and that he had named you specifically in his will, your dread of what he could possibly want from you has grown throughout your entire journey to Ravengro.\n\nYears of living with the fear and uncertainty of the unclaimed debt to Professor Lorrimor have inured you to extreme anxiety.

It seems as if the land itself rejects creatures buried in it and forces them out to roam the world as undead horrors. No one knows exactly why this is so, but there is certainly no shortage of theories.\n\nUnfortunately, theories do little to protect the people as they lay in their beds at night.\n\nOnly Samuel, a local cleric possessed the inner will strong enough to combat the undead terrorizing his parishioners. Though Samuel could destroy the lesser creatures, the zombies, the ghouls, the wights, his powers were not great enough to thwart the stronger undead, the shadows and vampires. The problem was bigger than he was capable of dealing with alone.\n\nAnd so, Samuel traveled to meet with Althagast, a white necromancer who lived in a ruined tower hidden in the dark hills surrounding many of the towns.\n\n&quot;Give us a weapon to combat these evil undead,&quot; Samuel begged.\n\n&quot;I will create such a weapon for you,&quot; Althagast promised, &quot;come back on the next full moon and I will give you what you ask for.&quot;\n\nAnd so, on the next full moon, Samuel returned to the white necromancer&apos;s tower.\n\n&quot;Do you have the weapon?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;I do,&quot; Althagast said, and handed the cleric a shield, decorated with a large, grinning skull.\n\n&quot;But this is not a weapon!&quot; Samuel said. &quot;How will this help me fight the undead that are over running our homes?&quot;\n\n&quot;This shield is indeed a weapon, but it is much more. In addition to helping you to fight and destroy undead, it will also protect you from them at the same time. Have faith.&quot;\n\nChastened by a man who ostensibly had none, Samuel took the shield down into the lands that surrounded the town and began his work. He found the shield, which he dubbed Grinning Skull, to be everything the white necromancer had promised. It seemed that by harnessing the powers of necromancy it could better affect creatures created through the same dark energies.\n\nSamuel cut a swath through the undead hordes.  He rooted out a nest of vampires and their spawn, eventually dragging the kicking and screaming vampire lord into the purifying light of the sun. He vaporized a spectre haunting a lonely road. He even put to rest a lich that had taken up residence nearby, drawn by the large number of undead.\n\nOne evening, as the people were leaving the cleric&apos;s temple after an especially heart-felt sermon, a beautiful woman lingered. Samuel did not recognize her, but since his fame as an undead killer had grown, he often saw new people at his sermons.\n\n&quot;Your fame precedes you, good cleric,&quot; the beautiful woman said, &quot;it is truly a great honor to speak with you.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, my child.&quot; Samuel smiled. &quot;It is the power of my faith and the power of my shield that are responsible for any fame I may have.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah yes,&quot; she said softly, her eyes narrowing, &quot;I have heard stories of your wondrous shield. Where is it, by the way? I would love to catch a glimpse of it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I keep the shield locked in my inner sanctuary, where it is safe.&quot; Samuel glanced around and saw that the temple was now empty of townspeople. &quot;I could show it to you if you like.&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; the young woman said, &quot;I think that I do not wish to see it after all. I think that perhaps you may wish you had it with you now, though ?&quot;\n\nSamuel&apos;s smile faded as he tilted his head questioningly at the woman.\n\nIt was then that he noticed, as if for the first time, her deathly pale complexion.\n\nAnd her vampire fangs...\n\nThough Samuel no longer protects the land, other stalwart souls have organized under his example to keep the north lands clear of undead. It is rumored the Grinning Skull sits buried in some forgotten crypt, a trophy for the vampire who ended Samuel&apos;s career." compset="MagicArmor" summary="This shield is decorated with a large, grinning skull.

Her songs charmed the wildest beasts, made men swoon, and caused birds to sit quietly in their roosts. It was said even the elements calmed their riotous nature to listen while she sang.\n\nThis was true. The winds of the four directions hovered quietly over her head whenever she sang. They prided themselves as the carriers of her songs. If Yuki Hana&apos;s voice seemed to range across the country as if borne by the wind, that was true.\n\nAristocrats, wealthy merchants and warriors courted her with gifts and promises. She refused them all, realizing they simply desired her for the fame or the recognition she would bring to them. The four winds, sensing her unhappiness, blew across these men, making them shiver or sweat, knocking off hairpieces and opening cloaks that concealed fat bellies or crooked legs. Embarrassed, the men retreated to chase some easier conquest.\n\nHowever, every day a monk from the Monastery of Weng sat outside Yuki&apos;s window to listen to her sing. She asked if he wanted to marry her. He said he desired only to listen, and revel in the contemplative joy of her voice.\n\nRealizing this monk, Fan To, possessed no designs, Yuki immediately fell in love with him.\n\nHer songs grew despondent with unrequited love, but they also became even more beautiful. People cried when her voice reached them. Even the hardest-hearted daimyo was moved to make peace with his enemies when he heard Yuki&apos;s songs carried across the countryside.\n\nThe great mountain oni, Isanamataka decided he would possess Yuki. His attempts to marry her disguised as a handsome noble had failed.  He swept down from his mountain fortress and carried her away.\n\nThe next day when Fan To came to hear Yuki&apos;s song he was dismayed at her absence. The four winds told him what happened and allowed him to hear her sad voice crying from the oni&apos;s dungeon. Fan To despaired. He possessed no means to battle a powerful oni.\n\n&quot;We can help you,&quot; the winds said. Each then infused Fan To&apos;s spear with their essence, and instructed on him how to draw upon their power.\n\nFan To immediately set off to find Yuki. The winds lead him on, carrying Yuki&apos;s voice to him so he could follow her songs.\n\nThe battle at the oni&apos;s home was brief. The four winds in Fan To&apos;s spear overwhelmed the evil creature. For years afterward the spear of the four winds was passed on to the greatest warrior of the Monastery of Weng, but more recently it was lost during a battle with an air demon who desired the spear for his own." compset="MagicWep" summary="For years this spear has been passed on to the greatest warrior of the Monastery of Weng, but more recently it was lost during a battle with an air demon who desired the spear for his own.">

Their howls reverberate through the canyons and down the cliffs, striking terror in the hearts of the North Men who call the place home.\n\nLife there grows perilous during the deepest part of the winter, for it is at that time the sun sinks below the jagged peaks and does not rise until a month later. The evil beings -- strange fungoid-like insects, who shun the daylight -- descend from their mountain caves to slay the men and women living at the range&apos;s feet. Fire and torch are useless since darkness seems to follow the creatures like a malignant air.\n\nThe winter-shaman of the North Men, T&apos;long, realized his people would disappear after a few more years of these depredations. Unwilling to abandon his ancestral home and leave the burial places of his forefathers to these creatures from the outside, the shaman constructed a special weapon to defend his people.\n\nHe fashioned a star-stone into a Dorn-Dergar. He anointed the shaft with oil from the sea-whale and called the weapon {b}Night Dorn-Dergar{/b}, not because it draws on the evil powers of darkness, but because it draws power from the cold aether of the star-lit sky and allows a man to defend himself when in darkness.\n\nT&apos;long wielded the weapon himself. He stood alone outside the village gate, daring the space-spawn to attack.  Instead of scaling the palisades to terrorize his fellow villagers the creatures attacked T&apos;long. He battled long and hard. After slaying a dozen foes, T&apos;long collapsed on the blood-stained snow. His death renewed the spirit of his clan&apos;s warriors. Now the North Men do not greet the falling sun with terror, but with an expectant confidence that though the fight may be hard, it is not futile." compset="MagicWep" summary="The {b}Night Dorn-Dergar{/b} draws not on the evil powers of darkness, but from the cold aether of the star-lit sky and allows a man to defend himself when in darkness." uniqueness="useronce">

Should you decide, of your own free will, not to keep the item, it returns to where it came from.\n\n{b}Notes:{/b} Any spell-like abilities gained through the use of this legendary weapon are based on the wielder&apos;s highest mental characteristic (Int, Wis, or Cha).  The caster level required for any effects of the legendary weapon are based on the wielder&apos;s total Hit Dice.  Any reference to level on an ability refers to the items level, not the wielders level.\n\n{b}Requirements:{/b} In order to bond with the weapon and allow it to level with you, you must have a minimum of 4 ranks in Intimidate and 4 ranks in Knowledge (geography).  In order for you to overcome the jealousy of the weapon, you must have the Improved Bull Rush and Power Attack Feats\n\n{b}Description:{/b}\n\nBane of the Seven Principalities, the great minotaur of Huq known as Asterion ruled his kingdom with an iron fist. Not so much a despot as a scourge, Asterion rarely appeared outside his ancient labyrinth-fortress.  He fielded no army and possessed no lieutenants who carried out orders or made sure his subjects followed his will. If and when Asterion desired tribute or sacrifice he appeared at a vassal&apos;s home and took what he wanted. Those who resisted died.\n\nAs part of the tribute that placated the beast, the Seven Principalities each year sent one young man and one young woman to his castle. No mystery surrounded their fates. Asterion hunted and ate the children.  The year no tribute was sent Asterion rampaged through the countryside, slaying cattle, knocking down farmhouses and slaughtering the populace.\n\nSalvation appeared in the form of a young man. No one knew him, but he volunteered to take the place of a victim. When the group arrived at the gate to Asterion&apos;s hold, he went in first, telling the rest to stay behind until he emerged. He fearlessly confronted the minotaur, tore the creature&apos;s halberd out of its dirty hands and plunged the blade into the monster&apos;s heart. As the bull-man thrashed and bellowed, his slayer revealed his true form -- an archon come to end Asterion&apos;s vile reign.  Instead of casting Asterion&apos;s soul into Hell, the archon cursed him, declaring from now on it would inhabit the very halberd that took the beast&apos;s life, forever without pleasure, forever a servant of another creature.\n\nIn that moment the weapon {i}Asterion&apos;s Soul{/i} was made. The minotaur&apos;s soul grants the wielder powers associated with the bull-beasts. When employed the wielder hears Asterion raging at his fate and forced servitude." compset="MagicWep" uniqueness="useronce">
