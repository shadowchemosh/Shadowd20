When the creature is living again, it knows the answer to this question. The answer can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn&#146;t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The answer given is correct within the limits of a commune spell (though it normally gives more than a yes-or-no answer). &#147;Unclear&#148; is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient." compset="Feat" summary="Those you bring back from death come with knowledge gained through their contact with spirits of the dead." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMRebirth" name="Rebirth" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Ability to cast a spell that returns life to a dead creature\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you use a spell to restore a dead creature to life, you can expend an additional 1,000 gp of scented oils to grant the creature an entirely new life, rather than just give them their old life back. (If you avoid this additional cost in some way, this feat does not function.) The subject is restored to life at an age of its choice between its age at death, and the minimum age for adulthood of its race.\n\nThe subject also may change its ability scores as it wishes, though it cannot exceed its original potential. Calculate the ability point cost of its ability scores at death (not including any magic boosts, temporary bonuses, inherent bonuses, or racial modifiers) using the purchase method of ability score generation from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. The subject then re-purchases its ability scores using the point total just calculated. Add any magic boosts, temporary bonuses, inherent bonuses, or racial modifiers back to the ability scores. If the subjects Int score changes, it calculates its new skill point total and may spend them on a new set of skill ranks. If the subject has feats it no longer meets the prerequisites for, it may replace them with feats it does qualify for.\n\nFinally, the subject may change its name. Its new name, selected immediately upon returning from death, is its only name for all mystic purposes. For example if a spell allows a target to be selected by name, the subjects old name no longer functions, and claiming not to be the person of the original name is not lying for purposes of divination." compset="Feat" summary="You don&#146;t just restore the subject to life, you give them an entirely new life." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMSlflsRes" name="Selfless Resurrection" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Con 13, ability to cast a spell that returns life to a dead creature.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You may cast any spell that restores life to a dead creature as a standard action. You gain one permanent negative level, and may choose to also take any negative levels the creature raised would normally suffer (preventing the subject from suffering those negative levels). These act as if you had gained negative levels from being restored with a raise dead spell, and if you avoid this additional cost in some way, this feat does not function. (Like any permanent negative levels, these can be restored with a restoration or greater restoration spell cast with costly material components).\n\nIf you use this feat in conjunction with breath of life, it works even if the subject has been dead for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. Using this feat, you can even restore life to a creature that had died of old age, though it returns to life with just 1 year left before it dies of old age again (barring the application of other magics)." compset="Feat" summary="You can use your own life energy to restore the lives of others quickly" uniqueness="useronce">

You can &#147;lose&#148; any prepared spell in order to cast any the life-restoring spell as long as it is of the same level or lower. This otherwise follows the rules for a cleric&#146; spontaneous spellcasting.\n\nIf you are a spontaneous spellcaster (such as an oracle) you gain one bonus spell known. This must be a life-restoring spell on your class list that you could take as a spell known. At each character level, you may change what this bonus spell known is.\n\nAdditionally, once per day the material component cost of any life-restoring spell you cast is reduced by 50%." compset="Feat" summary="You can bring back the dead with surprising ease" uniqueness="useronce">
