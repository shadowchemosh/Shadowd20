  <thing id="puCreaSnd1" name="Deprecated - Create Sound" description="{B}If you see this please remove and re-add the correct Create Sound power to your character{/b}{BR}{BR}You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the power creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character.\n\nThe volume of sound created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.\n\nIf you wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five\nwords can be created, and those words repeat over and over until the duration expires or the power is dismissed. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon&apos;s roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +2 circumstance bonus opposed by the listener&apos;s Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.\n\nCreate sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that you later manipulate by manifesting control sound." compset="PsiPower" summary="Create the sound you desire.">
