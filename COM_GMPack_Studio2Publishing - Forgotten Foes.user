  <thing id="ruGrimlock" name="Grimlock" description="Foul, subterranean creatures, grimlocks form primitive societies and spend most of their time hunting for food, fighting amongst themselves or attacking other creatures for loot and pillage. When roused, grimlocks form small war parties to raid other humanoids in search of food or slaves. It is not uncommon for grimlocks to raid surface communities in the mountains or near entrances to the underdeep. It is said they prefer human meat above all others. This has led some scholars to assume grimlocks descend from surface dwellers who lost their way in the lightless depths and eventually had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Since sight was not required in such an environment, grimlocks developed other senses at the cost of their eyes.\n\nBoth genders are muscular, gray in color (hence their natural camouflage), smelly, and hard to distinguish with a casual glance. Their primitive nature means grimlocks cannot form large or complex societies. Even if they did, their natural aggressiveness would soon turn them on each other. Rarely, a powerful warlock or medusa will organize several small tribes into a larger force but only for a short time.\n\nThe blindsight ability allows a grimlock to &#147;see&#148; normally to a range of 40 feet. Beyond that, they treat all creatures as if they had total concealment. This means grimlocks prefer melee to ranged combat but they will make use of short-ranged missile weapons such as knives, axes, and stones. They rely on hearing and smell to detect their environment. If either sense is negated, a grimlock fights as if it had the Blind-Fight feat. A grimlock without either sense takes penalties as if it were blind.\n\nGrimlocks with class levels are almost always barbarians, rangers or rogues, and very rarely sorcerers who usually possess the aberrant bloodline." compset="Race">
