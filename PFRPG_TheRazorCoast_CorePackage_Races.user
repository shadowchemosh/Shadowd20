  <thing id="rFGMenehun" name="Menehune" description="Blessed by the fires of their patron deity Pele, the small and industrious menehune live deep within the Razor Coast&apos;s thick tropical forests, far from the eyes of the Tulita and colonists of the coast. Since the coming of the foreign colonists the menehune have maintained little contact with the outside world, though remain on favorable terms with other children of Pele, particularly fire giants. While they were close with the Tulita in centuries past, the race has taken a decidedly neutral position and removed themselves from the affairs of mankind, so much so that few foreigners have seen a menehune and many doubt their existence. Still, the menehune have left behind examples of their culture and craftsmanship throughout the Razor Coast region, with ancient temples, fishponds, stone houses, and long forgotten roads. Similar in size and stature to gnomes, menehune complexions range from light olive to darker skin tones. They have thick visibly raised veins through which races their fiery blood, and they easily flush when angered or excited. Menehune take great pride in their coarse and wild hair, coloring it exotic colors with plant dyes and fashioning it into long spikes with lime, blood, and goat dung. \n\nWhile they once lived in large cities, the menehune have returned to a simpler life, inhabiting smaller agrarian communities that subsist by herding, farming, fishing, and trading with other menehune villages. During the darkest nights of the year, they hold multi-community burning celebrations, unrestrained parties where they roast slaughtered boars, wrestle, drink fermented goat&apos;s milk, trade, tell tales, and meet lovers from neighboring villages. \n\nDespite their reclusive nature, when young menehune come of age they are expected to travel for a few years in order to experience the world before settling down. The menehune people call this tradition &quot;taming the fire.&quot; During this time, young menehune wander the Razor Coast, seeking adventure, fortune, philosophy, and whatever else the outer realm might offer them. When their curiosity is finally slaked, the menehune either returns to his former village or adopts a new one and settles down." compset="Race">

  <thing id="cfgFGTulTa" name="Tulita Tattoo" description="The Tulita art of tattooing is as ancient as the ocean. Most among the tribes bear the legacy of their family or the record of their own great deeds inscribed upon their flesh. Some of these tattoos are more than mere decoration or history. Shaman use potent alchemical inks ground from various herbs and plants at specific times of the day or year, and employ old scrimshaw needles filled with the mana of their tribe to inscribe powerful tattoos on the flesh of a warrior in an ancient rite. Only Tulita wise men and women know the ancient rituals necessary to inscribe these pictograms properly.\n\nThe magic of these tattoos can only be activated three times per day. A creature may only bear one of these tattoos. When a Tulita PC reaches 7th level, instead of taking their bonus feat for this level, they may opt to gain a tattoo instead as a rite of passage. If they do not choose to do so at 7th level, they may do so at 11th or higher in lieu of taking a new feat then." compset="Configure" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rFGTikiman" name="Tikiman" description="A yohunga begins play with a tikiman, a small construct he creates.\n\nThe tikiman is bonded to his creator, can understand and follow his instructions, and does so without question. To activate his tikiman, the yohunga imbues it with his own mana, mystic energies that collect in his blood that connect him to the spirit world. So long as he maintains at least 1 point of mana in his mana pool (see below) he can animate the tikiman, also granting it a spark of intelligence. The spark of intelligence grants the tikiman the ability to use skills and special tiki powers chosen by yohunga as the tiki progresses. If the yohunga&apos;s mana is ever completely depleted the tikiman becomes inanimate until he rests and replenishes his mana pool. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, the yohunga can create an additional tikiman." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rFGDajobas" name="Dajobasu" description="Every so often a Tulita child is born with subtle but disturbingly monstrous features - tough and leathery skin, thick crocodilian teeth, and pale golden eyes. Tribal elders refer to these children as dajobasu, roughly translated as spawn of the Shark God. The birth of such a child is typically viewed as a curse, a dark punishment upon either the child&apos;s parents or the village for some transgression against Dajobas. In rare instances, a tribe may instead view the birth of a dajobasu as a gift, believing that the child was sent to strike down the tribe&apos;s enemies or liberate them from oppressors. While such individuals become venerated champions, most Tulita treat dajobasu with fearful contempt, quickly ostracizing them from their communities.\n\nColonial society is no more accepting of the dajobasu. Colonists tend to explain such births as the results of Tulita interbreeding, or as proof of their violent and tainted bloodlines. Ultimately, the precise cause of this phenomenon remains unknown.\n\nThough monstrous by human standards, a dajobasu&apos;s features remain subtle enough that at a distance one might easily mistake them for a Tulita. Their skin is similarly colored and they share roughly the same builds and hair. Only on closer inspection does one readily perceive the differences. Their skin is thick with hard ridges, almost like the callused hide of an alligator, and a few even have short, vestigial tails. Their brows are broad, their teeth are wide and jagged, and the pupils of their golden eyes slit sideways. Dajobasu bare a noticeable resemblance to the Karikanti gator men, another group of humanoid also believed to have once been a Tulita tribe cursed by Dajobas." compset="Race">
