      ~ Make Mythic Surges a free action
      #appenddesc[MythSurge,"{b}Shadow d20:{/b} This is now a FREE action to use instead of a immediate action. This means you can use multiple surges to increase a single d20 roll up to your Mythic Tier. So in example if you are Mythic Tier 2 then you could add up to two surges to your d20 roll. I think this feels more mythic and is balanced by the limited number of surges per day."]
