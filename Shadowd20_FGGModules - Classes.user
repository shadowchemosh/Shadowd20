Justicar of Muir - Fort save does not fit into the 3 selections.  1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6

Class Special Tab:

Cloak of Orcus - Eval Script line 18 - Cannot get the right side of the expression to calculate correctly.  I have it listed  as a note currently so that you can see what I did.

Friend of Death - DC is not calculating correctly

Necromantic Power - Not sure how to do this one.  I think it is just adding a name to the end of the ability, but not sure how to keep it adjusting to include extra dice

Greater Summoning - This is an improvement to Summon Undead ability, and should replace it when aplied at level 9.

Touch of the Dead God - The DC on this ability is not standard.  I do not know how to calculate it.

Enemy of Evil - Is this best to just leave as text, or code it somehow?

Celestial Companion - Level 1 Class Feature - No clue how to do this.

Shield of Truth - Another wierd one where I want to search for a current shield, add to the AC to it, and possibly add Gizmo for Blinding ability.  If no shield is present, we just add a shield bonus.  Might be easier to add a flat AC bonus with no Gizmo.  Can not be used with Sword of Courage or Armor of Honor.  (Once Avatar is obtained at level 10, they can be used together)

Sword of Courage - See ability for text, and Notes above for Shield of Truth

Armor of Honor - See ability for text, and Notes above for Shield of Truth

Avatar - See Sword, Shield and Armor ability

Scourge of Evil - Holy hell!  Read the description...Stacks with everything...HELP!!!

Demon-Bane - Stacks again....WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!</info_todo>

  <thing id="cDiscOrcus" name="Disciple of Orcus" description="{b}Additional Requirement{/b}: The disciple must also bind his or her soul to the eternal service of Orcus through interaction with a demon and a special ritual. The Disciple must seek out this demon on his or her own. Potential Disciples deemed unworthy by the demon are normally devoured.\n\nThere are priests of Orcus, and there are Disciples of Orcus; fanatics who go to great lengths to appease their chosen lord. They begin their journey down the path of evil and death learning simple abilities that allow them to manipulate and control the dead. As they grow in power, the Disciples become closer and closer to their god, until finally, the penultimate power level is achieved; that of undeath itself.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} Clerics most often become Disciples of Orcus. As a matter of fact, no class without at least some divine spellcasting ability can ever hope to follow the path of the Disciple. Fighters, bards, wizards, sorcerers, and druids sometimes become Disciples of Orcus. Barbarians, monks, rangers, and rogues generally do not. A paladin can never become a Disciple of Orcus without changing alignments (though a fallen paladin/blackguard can).\n\nAn NPC Disciple of Orcus will be found anywhere there is a temple to Orcus, though most will be secluded or well hidden, as the worship of such a being is not widely accepted (something the Disciples hope to change in the near future). Their last known high altar was located in the lost city of Tsar, though many suspect a new center of worship was erected in the infamous Dungeon of Graves after Tsar&apos;s fall." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

In addition, the PC must have taken his last level as a paladin prior to becoming a Justicar.\n\n{b}Weapon and Armor Proficiency:{/b} Justicar&apos;s gain proficiency in the bastard sword as an exotic weapon per the feat Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword).\n\n{b}Quest:{/b} A Justicar-to-be must complete an arduous {i}quest{/i} of some significance to Muir to demonstrate his worth to Muir before he may be ordained (see below).\n\n{b}Ordination:{/b} This is the most difficult of the requirements to become a Justicar. A Justicar of Muir must be ordained by a person with power to ordain Justicars. This power is only held by clerics of Muir of 13th level or higher and clerics of Thyr of 16th level or higher. Once the Justicar-to-be proves himself worthy by a {i}quest{/i} (see above), the ordaining priest must cast {i}bless{/i}, {i}zone of truth{/i}, {i}prayer{/i}, {i}discern lies{/i}, {i}mark of justice{/i}, {i}righteous might{/i}, and {i}holy word{/i} upon the Justicar-to-be. This ordination ritual also requires the presence of a holy relic of Muir, such as the {i}Stone of Tircople{/i}, the {i}Holy Sword of Karith{/i}, or the {i}Sword of Gerrant{/i}. Ordination should be a difficult and arduous process. A PC should not be allowed to become a Justicar of Muir simply because he meets the other prerequisites.\n\n{b}Class Limitations:{/b} Due to the length of the Limitations, these are added on the Class Tab\n\n{b}Description:{/b}\n\nA Justicar of Muir is the living embodiment of the first and most important of the triune virtues of Muir - Truth. As an embodiment of truth, and in keeping with the strictness of Muir, a Justicar of Muir must follow an extremely strict moral code beyond that required of a common paladin. The benefit of this purity and stricture is awe-inspiring - eventually allowing the Justicar of Muir to become an avatar of Muir herself.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} Justicars of Muir are the elite paladins in the worship of Muir. While there may be many paladins of Muir, there can never be more than 13 Justicars of Muir alive at any one time. The leader of the Justicars of Muir is known as the Grandmaster. The grandmaster must be a Justicar of at least 8th level.\n\nBecause the worship of Muir has waned substantially, it would be appropriate if there were no current Justicars in your game world and no priests of the necessary level to ordain a Justicar - thus requiring the PCs to find Flail&apos;s spirit or free Abysthor to locate a priest capable of ordaining a Justicar.\n\n{b}{i}Justicars in the Necromancer Games/Frog God Games World{/i}{/b}\n\nThe world in which {b}{i}The Slumbering Tsar Saga{/b} {/i}and the modules of {b}Necromancer Games{/b} are set, depicts a time when newer gods have replaced the older gods, such as Thyr and Muir. Their powers are on the decline. There are currently no living Justicars of Muir in the world, nor were there any when Canaara came to visit the priests of Thyr and Muir and captured the famed {i}Holy Sword of Karith{/i} (see module {b}{i}L1: Demons and Devils{/b} {/i}by {b}Necromancer Games{/b} for more details). The heyday of the Justicars was the time of the rule of the Second and Third High Lords, who ruled from the holy city of Tircople before its downfall during the time of the Battle of Tsar. The ordination of a Justicar of Muir should be an event for the world to notice - symbolizing the resurrection of the power of the older gods and a warning sign to all creatures of evil. Most current religions believe Justicars are but exaggerated myths.\n\nUsing a similar theme of decline and redemption in your campaign would serve to highlight even further the PC&apos;s quest to become a Justicar. Certainly, recovering the {i}Holy Sword of Karith{/i} ({b}{i}L1: Demons and Devils{/b}{/i}), freeing Abysthor from his imprisonment ({b}{i}D1: The Tomb of Abysthor{/b}{/i}), or resolving the ancient mystery of the slumbering city of Tsar ({b}{i}The Slumbering Tsar Saga{/b}{/i}) would justify ordination as a Justicar." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

  <thing id="cJMuClaLim" name="Class Limitations" description="Justicars must follow a strict and rather unforgiving moral code.  Failure to follow these rules may result in the PC becoming a ex- Justicar.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} A Justicar must be lawful good. In addition to the strictures placed on a paladin, a Justicar must live by the following additional limitations:\n\n{b}Reject Cohorts and Henchmen:{/b} A Justicar may never gain followers, cohorts, henchmen, or hirelings. If, at the time of becoming a Justicar, the character has followers, cohorts, henchmen, or hirelings, he must renounce them and free them of their bonds of fealty or obligation. In addition, a Justicar may not hire men-at-arms. A Justicar may retain his special mount, if gained while a paladin. Once slain, however, a Justicar may not call a new mount. The only exception to this limitation is that a Justicar may retain his falcon familiar (see below) as long as he remains a Justicar. Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar. Unintentional disobedience (accidentally obtaining a cohort because the cohort was enchanted to follow you, for example) requires {i}atonement{/i} and the Justicar must break the enchantment and rid himself of the cohort as quickly as possible. A simple offer by a prospective follower or cohort to follow you, if rejected, does not constitute disobedience.  This requirement does not prevent a Justicar from traveling with companions.\n\n{b}Reject Property:{/b} A Justicar may not own real property - land, buildings or other holdings, nor may he circumvent this by having agents or friends hold such property in his name. Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar. Unintentional disobedience (inherited land, for example) requires {i}atonement{/i}. A gift of land, if rejected, does not constitute disobedience.\n\n{b}Reject Wealth:{/b} A Justicar may not possess more material wealth than is required to feed, clothe, and house his person in a modest fashion (usually no more than 100 gp). Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar.  Unintentional disobedience (inheriting wealth, for example) requires {i}atonement{/i}. A gift of money or wealth, if rejected, does not constitute disobedience.\n\n{b}Reject Material Property and Magic:{/b} A Justicar may not carry more than his arms and armor, a pack with simple equipment, equipment for his mount, simple religious items, and simple clothes. He may not possess ornamental items. He may not possess magic items other than his arms and armor. He may, however, carry and use potions and scrolls created by priests of Thyr and Muir. Aside from arms and armor, all a Justicar need possess is faith in Muir. Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar. Unintentional disobedience requires {i}atonement{/i}. Having a barred item hidden on you by an enemy, if unwanted, does not constitute disobedience if the Justicar immediately rejects the item once discovered.\n\n{b}Reject Disguise:{/b} As an embodiment of Truth, a Justicar may not thwart truth, regardless how noble the goal. Though he may tolerate it in others, a Justicar will not willingly disguise himself, accept magic intended to conceal or disguise his person or qualities, nor may he use protective magic based on disguise or hidden appearance. He will counsel against his companions using such tactics, though he will not split with persons who are otherwise good-aligned as a result of their use of such tactics. The Justicar simply will not take part in them. Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar.  Unintentional disobedience (having a disguising spell cast upon you by a friend against your will) requires {i}atonement{/i}. Having a disguise or concealment spell cast upon you by an enemy, if unwanted, does not constitute disobedience if the Justicar immediately seeks to undo the disguise.\n\n{b}Reject Falsehood:{/b} A Justicar may not lie, regardless of how noble the goal. Lying means active deception. Standing silent or failing to answer a question is not lying. However, if a Justicar fails to answer a question because of an intent to deceive, he must do {i}atonement{/i}. Willful disobedience of this principle results in the character becoming an ex-Justicar. Unintentional disobedience (being magically compelled or otherwise forced to lie against your will, for example) requires {i}atonement{/i}. Because a Justicar embodies Truth, the GM is encouraged to demand the strictest compliance to this principle." compset="ClSpecial">

He loses all Justicar spells and class features (including the service of the Justicar&apos;s falcon familiar, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as a Justicar, nor can he ever regain his status as a Justicar. Muir is a strict and demanding goddess.\n\n{b}Torment:{/b} The above rules allow evil NPCs (or characters) to torment Justicars - attempting to give them wealth, magically disguising them against their will, etc. An evil creature can never cause a Justicar to become an ex-Justicar by such torment unless the Justicar willingly joins or fails to reject the evil character. At worst, such actions may require the Justicar to do {i}atonement{/i}. Note that in the case of such torment, a Justicar is free to attempt to slay the tormenting evil NPC prior to attempting to undo the source of the torment (breaking the spell on a charmed cohort, dismissing the {i}obscuring mist{/i} spell placed upon him, giving away treasure, etc.).  The only exception is lying. If a Justicar willfully lies, even to an evil opponent, he becomes an ex-Justicar." compset="ClSpecial">
