  <thing id="rShifters" name="Shifter" description="{b}Shapechanger Subtype:{/b} Shifters are humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.\n\nShifters, sometimes called &quot;the weretouched,&quot; are descended from humans and natural lycanthropes, now nearly extinct on Khorvaire. Shifters cannot fully change shape but can take on animalistic features&apos;a state they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique race that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its own traditions and identity.\n\n{b}Personality:{/b} The personality and behavior of shifters are infl uenced by their animal natures. Many are boorish and crude, while others are quiet, shifty, and solitary. Just as most lycanthropes are carnivores, shifters have a predatory personality and think of most activities in terms of hunting and prey. They view survival as a challenge, striving to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.\n\n{b}Physical Description:{/b} Shifters are basically humanoid in shape, but their bodies are exceptionally lithe. They often move in a crouched posture, springing and leaping while their companions walk normally alongside. Their faces have a bestial cast, with wide, fl at noses, large eyes and heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, and long sideburns (in both sexes). Their forearms and lower legs grow long hair, and the hair of their heads is thick and worn long.\n\n{b}Relations:{/b} Many races feel uncomfortable around shifters, the same way they feel around any large predator. Of course, some grow to appreciate individual shifters despite their natural aversion, and halflings in general get along well with them. For their part, shifters are accustomed to distrust and don’t expect better treatment from members of the other races, although some shifters try to earn respect and companionship through acts and deeds.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Shifters are usually neutral, viewing the struggle to survive as more important than moral or ethical concerns about how survival is maintained.\n\n{B}Pathfinder:{/b} The ability score bonus/penalties have been changed slightly to no longer get a -2 Cha penalty and instead gain a +2 bonus to Wis. This fits with other Pathfinder core races better.  Shfiting has also been changed to be rounds per day simliar to the Barbarian rage ability." compset="Race">

Each shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to one of the character’s physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other advantage as well. Shifter traits are described in the following section.\n\nA shifter can shift for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + Constitution modifier + half her character level. Starting a shift or ending is a free action that can only happen on a characters turn. Every shifter feat a character takes allows her to shift for 1 additional round per day.  For every two shifter feats a character takes, the shifter gains a bonus 1 round per day on top of the one gained for the shifter feat itself. In example if a shifter has two shifter feats they can shift for 3 additional rounds per day not 2." compset="RaceSpec">

  <thing id="rS2Changel" name="Changeling" description="Changelings are subtle shapeshifters capable of disguising their appearance. They evolved through the union of doppelgangers and humans, eventually becoming a separate race distinct from either ancestral tree. They do not possess the full shapechanging ability of a doppelganger, but they can create effective disguises at will. This ability makes them consummate spies and criminals, and many changelings live up to that potential.\n\n{b}Personality:{/b} In general, changelings are prudent and cautious, preferring to take risks only when they feel that their chances of success are good or the payoff is worth it. They appreciate the fi ner things in life and take great pleasure in the comforts of a wealthy lifestyle when they can obtain it. They avoid direct confrontation, preferring stealthy s trikes and h asty retreats whenev er possible. In conversation, they are soft-spoken but have a gift for drawing out more information than the other party intends to reveal.\n\n{b}Physical Description:{/b} Changelings strongly resemble their doppelganger lineage, with only a passing nod to their human heritage. All changelings fall within the boundaries of Medium size, usually standing between 5 and 6 feet tall. Unlike true doppelgangers, changelings do have gender in their natural form, although they can adopt any shape they like. Changelings have pale gray skin, and their hair is thin and fair. Their limbs are long and slightly out of proportion compared to other humanoids. Their faces have slightly more distinct features than a doppelganger’s, including a hint of nose and lips, though their eyes remain blank white and the rest of their facial features don’t look quite as fi nished as those on a human.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Changelings of all alignments exist, but most gravitate toward the neutral alignment. They focus on their own concerns without any meaningful regard for laws or morals. Many have their own code of honor but are also fi ercely independent. Some refuse to engage in assassination, while others embrace that path as the most perfect form of the changeling art of deception.\n\n{b}Natural Linguist:{/b} Changelings add Linguistics to their list of class skills for any class they adopt.\n\n{B}Pathfinder:{/b} The changeling&apos;s &quot;Shape Change&quot; ability has been changed to act as Alter Self now instead of Disguse Self. This means when shape changing into a Medium creature they gain a +2 size bonus to Str.  When shape changed into a small sized creature they gain a +2 size bonus to Dex. This hopefully balances the race better vs Pathfinder core classes." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rS2Warforg" name="Warforged" description="Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creature - living constructs.\n\nWarforged are renowned for their combat prowess, their size, and their single-minded focus. They make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. Earlier warforged models are true constructs; some of these remnants of the Last War appear in monstrous varieties, such as the warforged titan (described on page 302).\n\n{b}Personality:{/b} The warforged were made to fight in the Last War, and they continue to fulfill their purpose with distinction. They fight fiercely and usually without remorse, displaying adaptability impossible for mindless constructs. Now that the war has ended, the warforged seek to adapt to life in this era of relative peace. Some have settled easily into new roles as artisans or laborers, while others wander as adventurers or even continue fi ghting the Last War despite the return of peace.\n\n{b}Physical Description:{/b} Warforged appear as massive humanoids molded from a composite of materials - obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material - though they move with a surprising grace and fl exibility. Flexible plates connected by fi brous bundles make up the body of a warforged, topped by a mostly featureless head.\n\nWarforged have no physical distinction of gender; all of them have a basically muscular, sexless body shape. In personality, some warforged seem more masculine or feminine, but different people might judge the same warforged in different ways. The warforged themselves seem unconcerned with matters of gender. They do not age naturally, though their bodies do decay slowly even as their minds improve through learning and experience.\n\n{b}Relations:{/b} As the warforged strive to fi nd a place in society for themselves after the Last War, they simultaneously struggle to fi nd ways to relate to the races that created them. In general, the humanoid races of Khorvaire regard the warforged as an unpleasant reminder of the brutality of the Last War and avoid dealing with them when possible.\n\nIn Thrane and Karrnath, the warforged are still seen as the property of the military forces that paid to have them built, and most warforged in those nations serve as slave labor, often used to repair buildings and roads damaged or destroyed in the war. Throughout the rest of Khorvaire, they have freedom but sometimes fi nd themselves the victims of discrimination, hard-pressed to fi nd work or any kind of acceptance. Most warforged, not being particularly emotional creatures, accept their struggles and servitude with equanimity, but others seethe with resentment against all other races as well as those warforged whose only desire is to please their &amp;quot;masters.&amp;quot;\nUnique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. Many warforged are adorned with heavier metal plates than those their creator originally endowed them with. This customized armor, built-in weaponry, and other enhancements to their physical form help to differentiate one warforged from another.\n\n{B}Pathfinder:{/b} The warforged body feats have been changed to racial option that you select at character creation. This fits into the pathfinder design much better." compset="Race">

They were once a minority among the quori, the native race of Dal Quor, hunted and persecuted for their religious beliefs. Thousands of years after the quori invaded Eberron and the connection between their plane and the Material Plane was severed, the kalashtar were the fi rst of the quori to discover a means to reach the Material Plane once more. Fleeing persecution, they transformed their physical forms into psychic projections that allowed them to enter the Material Plane and possess willing humans. Today, new kalashtar are born, not possessed; neither spirit nor human, they are a new race that breeds true.\n\nIt took three hundred years for the other quori to discover a similar means to psychically project their spirits out of Dal Quor and possess human bodies, forming the Inspired (see page 290), while leaving their own bodies behind - much as mortals project their minds to Dal Quor when they dream. For fi fteen hundred years now, the Inspired in their vast kingdom of Riedra have continued to persecute and oppress the kalashtar.\n\n{b}Personality:{/b} As a true hybrid of human hosts and quori spirits, the kalashtar possess keen intellects but are not ruled by logic. They seek the perfection of their minds and spirits, often to the exclusion of any physical pursuits.\n\nThey are generally warm and compassionate, but their manners and ways of thinking are alien to the native races of Eberron. They are more interested in psionics than in the magic that pervades Khorvaire, and often lace their discourse with esoteric terms such as &quot;matter,&quot; &quot;kinetics,&quot; and &quot;ectoplasm.&quot; The kalashtar are outcasts from their home plane and can never return there - not even in dream. The combination of life in exile and a dreamless existence makes the kalashtar slightly inclined toward madness, and some have speculated that the kalashtar devote themselves to psychic and physical discipline in order to keep themselves safely sane." compset="Race">
