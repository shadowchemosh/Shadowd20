In its place they get proficiency in all crossbows including Exotic.  They also gain Rapid Reload feat at level 1.  This gives them the ability with a light crossbow to be as good as a character with a longbow.

-Changed the behavoir of all Counters. On reset are reset back to the "max" value not zero. This means players should now count down instead of up.  So you add a Wand you can reset it 50/50 and then as you use charges you can remove. This should now work for all class abilities including Action Points.  So if I see action points of 5/12 this means you have 5 of 12 remaining. Not 7 left!

Every time a character advances, he gains a number of action points equal to 5 + 1/2 his new character level.\n\nWhen you spend 1 action point to improve a d20 roll, you add the result of a 1d6 to your d20 roll (including attack rolls, saves, checks, or any other roll of a d20) to help you meet or exceed the target number. You can declare the use of 1 action point to alter a d20 roll after the roll is made, but only before the GM reveals the result of that roll. You can’t use an action point to alter the result of a d20 roll when you are taking 10 or taking 20.\n\nDepending on character level, a character might be able to roll more than one d6 when he spends an action point. If so, apply the highest result and disregard the other rolls. A 15th-level character, for instance, gets to roll 3d6 and take the best result of the three. So, if he rolled a 1, 2, and 4, he would apply the 4 to his d20 roll. \n\n{B}1st-7th{/b} 1d6\n{B}8th-14th{/b} 2d6\n{B}15th-20th{/b} 3d6" compset="Tracker" replaces="hActionPts" uniqueness="useronce">
