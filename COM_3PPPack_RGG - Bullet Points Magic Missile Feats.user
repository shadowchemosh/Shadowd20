This focus changes the spell&#146;s range to short, and requires you to sacrifice some of the missiles you would normally receive from casting the spell. If you sacrifice two magic missiles from your volley, all the remaining missiles gain the power to dazzle foes damaged by them. If you sacrifice three magic missiles from your volley, all the remaining missiles gain the power to cause their targets to be dazzled and act as if inside an obscuring mist spell. If you sacrifice three magic missiles from your volley, all the remaining missiles (normally just 1) gain the power to blind foes damaged by them. Creatures receive a Fortitude save (DC10 +1/2 caster level + modifier of ability score that determines your spell DCs) to negate the Blinding Missile&#146;s effect.

  <thing id="fMHaloStar" name="Halo of Stars" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Cha 13, Magical Aptitude, ability to cast magic missile.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast magic missile, you may choose to have some or all of the missiles orbit your body as tiny motes of light rather than fly off to hit a target. While they orbit you (at a range of 1-5 feet) the missiles shed light like a torch. As a standard action you may fire off one or more of the missiles orbiting you, targeting them as normal for the magic missile spell. This does not require concentration (or verbal or somatic components), and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can have missiles from multiple castings orbit you, to a maximum number of missiles orbiting you at any one time equal to 1+ half your caster level. If you sleep or are knocked unconscious, all orbiting missiles fade away." compset="Feat" summary="You can keep your magic missiles around until you need them" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMImbdFrce" name="Imbued Force" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Arcane Strike, ability to cast magic missile.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast magic missile, you can use it to imbue a melee weapon you touch with the power to act as a force effect (able to strike ethereal targets). The weapon can act as a force effect for 1 successful melee attack per missile you normally receive when you cast magic missile. The weapon also counts as magic, for purposes of bypassing DR, and its successful force attacks deal +1d4+1 points of damage. These bonuses end after it has made its last successful force melee attack, or after 1 hour, whichever comes first. A weapon cannot gain the benefits of Imbued Force while it has any force attacks from the feat still active." compset="Feat" summary="You can layer your magic missiles onto a melee weapon, granting it limited ability to strike as a force effect." uniqueness="useronce">

This focus changes the spell&#146;s range to short, and requires you to sacrifice some of the missiles you would normally receive from casting the spell. If you sacrifice two magic missiles from your volley, all the remaining missiles gain the power to reduce all their targets&#146; movement rates by 5 feet.

If you take this option, all the missiles from one casting of the spell must be cast at the same target, though each gets its own attack roll. \n\n{b}Special{/b}: If your campaign uses a critical hit system that gives different results based on damage type (such as some critical hit card decks), if you score a critical hit with a magic missile while using Targeted Missile, you may select a critical hit result as if the attack was a spell or a piercing weapons, as you prefer." compset="Feat" summary="You can direct your magic missiles, rather than depend on their innate accuracy." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMArcMssle" name="Arcane Missiles" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ability to cast magic missile. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast magic missile, you may choose to use a magic arrow or bolt in your possession as a material component. When you do this, you may add any magical properties of the magic arrow to the effect of a single magic missile from your volley. You do not gain any benefit from the magic arrow&#146;s enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage. (If for some reason the magic missile requires an attack roll, such as if you are using the Targeted Missiles feat, you do receive the enhancement bonus to your attack roll, but still don&#146;t add it to damage.) The magic arrow or bolt is automatically destroyed in this process. \n\nIf the target you select for the augmented missile from your volley somehow protects itself from the missile&#146;s normal damage, it does not take any of the additional effects added by your material component. You can only use one magic arrow or bolt to augment you spell, and only one magic missile can be augmented each time you cast the spell. Some magic properties (such as speed) have no effect when added to a magic missile (the GM is the final arbiter of what effects apply).Only magic arrows that have gained their magic properties as a result of the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat can be used as material components for Arcane Missiles (you cannot, for example, use an arrow that gained its properties from the arcane pool ability of a magus).\n\nFor example, Azyra is a half-elf sorcerer who knows magic missile and has ten +1 flaming arrows. When she casts magic missile she can choose to use one of the magic arrows as a material component, and add its flaming magic quality a single missile (which then deals +1d6 fire damage). If the target she selects for the flaming magic missile has a shield spell, or SR Azyra fails to overcome, or in some other manner avoids the magic missile&#146;s normal 1d4+1 damage, the target doesn&#146;t take the additional 1d6 fire. Azyra does not get to add the arrow&#146;s +1 enhancement bonus to her damage. Regardless of the effect of the magic missile, the +1 flaming arrow is destroyed." compset="Feat" summary="You can add the magic effects of arrows or bolts in your possession to one magic missile of a volley" uniqueness="useronce">
