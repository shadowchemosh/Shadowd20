  <thing id="fSFGlutton" name="Gluttonous" description="You have turned stuffing yourself into an art form&#133; and a power.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Con 13.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You can eat and drink much more than a typical creature of your race and size. Over the course of 15 minutes you can, without suffering any ill effects, eat enough food to sustain a typical creature of your size for a whole day. For six hours after doing so you are inspired by the gratification you receive from stuffing yourself. You receive a +1 morale bonus to one of the following (selected at the time you end your meal): ability and skill checks tied to Strength, Constitution, or Intelligence (your choice); caster level; or weapon damage. You can only have one bonus from Gluttonous in effect at a time, and if you use the ability again before an old bonus fades, the original bonus immediately ends.\n\nYou also gain a +3 bonus on Fortitude saves against ingested diseases and poisons (but not other kinds of diseases and poisons), and every day you go without eating counts as 2 days without food for purposes of the starvation rules." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

This is a primary attack if it is the only attack you make in a round, otherwise it is a secondary attack. You do not threaten any space with your bite attack and cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity, though you can make attacks against creatures within your normal reach on your turn." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

If you spend an hour gnawing on something with a hardness or DR no greater than double your maximum bite damage, you can reduce its hardness/DR by 1. Every additional 1 reduction takes twice as long to achieve.\n\n{b}Special{/b}: Creatures with a natural bite attack may take this feat without having Big Mouth as a prerequisite." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fSFSuckUp" name="Suck it Up" description="You can force a target to expend more eldritch energy to fill your voracious gluttony when you are affected by a magic ability.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Con 13, Gluttonous, any 2 additional sinful feats.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: To use Suck It Up, you must take a ready action to absorb energy from the next spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that affects you. When you are targeted by such an ability while readied, you may choose to fail any saving throw the ability allows in order to Suck It Up. The creature affecting you must make a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 your HD + your Con modifier). On a failed check, the ability uses additional energy to fill your supernatural appetite. If the magic ability was a spell or spell-like ability, the attacker loses one additional spell slot or prepared spell of the same level or higher. If the ability can normally be used once in a limited time period (such as once every 1d4 rounds, or once a day), instead the recharge time is doubled. If the ability can normally be used at will, the attacker cannot use it for 1d4 rounds.\n\nAt 8th level on a failed save you force the attacker to spend three spell slots, prepared spells, or uses per day (or triple a recharge time). At 16th level on a failed save you force the attacker to spend four spell slots, prepared spells, or uses per day (or quadruple a recharge time)." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
