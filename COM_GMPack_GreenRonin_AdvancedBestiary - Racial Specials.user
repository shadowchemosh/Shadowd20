  <thing id="rauDPSplVl" name="Spell Vulnerability" description="Certain powerful spells have special additional effects against demon-possessed creatures. These spells must first overcome the demon&apos;s spell resistance (if any) to have any effect.\n\nA demon-possessed creature subjected to a dispel chaos or dispel evil spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose all the modifications bestowed by the demon-possessed creature template for a number of rounds equal to the opponent&apos;s caster level. The demon is immediately ejected from the possessed creature&apos;s body and appears in the nearest open square.\n\nA demon-possessed creature subjected to a banishment spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose the template until again possessed by a demon. Failure returns the demon to its home plane, as noted in the spell description.\n\nAn antimagic field or any antimagic effect suppresses all the effects of the demon-possessed creature template. It also prevents the demon from communicating with the possessed creature, using its perceptions, and exiting its body (unless it dies) for as long as the demon-possessed creature remains in the antimagic area.\n\nIn addition, particular spells can affect the weaker demon kinds, as noted on the following table. In each case, when the spell indicated for that demon (or any demon of higher CR on the table) targets the demon-possessed creature, the demon is expelled as described for dismissal (above), assuming that the creature fails any associated saving throw and the spell penetrates the demon&apos;s spell resistance. Spells cast by the possessed creature do not have this effect.\n\n{b}Spell Vulnerability\nDemon  -  CR  -  Spell{/b}\nDretch        2     Virtue\nQuasit        2     Protection from evil/chaos\nBabau         6     Break enchantment\nSuccubus  7     Remove curse" compset="RaceSpec">

It cannot be targeted by any spell or effect (except as described under spell vulnerability), but it can be detected normally by divination spells.\n\nDamage that harms the possessed creature does not harm the possessing demon.

This ability has the same effect as a dream spell, except that once inside the dream of another creature, the nightmare creature can control the dream world with which the sleeper interacts.\n\nWhen the nightmare creature first arrives in the dream, it can deliver a message, as described in the dream spell. So long as it does not attempt to control the victim&apos;s dreams, this message is harmless and the dreamer can awaken at any time.\n\nImmediately upon entering the victim&apos;s dream or at any time thereafter while it remains there, the nightmare creature can attempt to control the victim&apos;s dream. The victim must then succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 nightmare creature&apos;s character level + nightmare creature&apos;s Cha modifier) or remain unconscious and asleep, trapped in the dream world with the nightmare creature. The nightmare creature controls all aspects of the dream world, and the victim is powerless to change anythingâ€”although the nightmare creature might allow it to think it has such power or even that it has awakened from the dream. Each hour thereafter, the victim must make a new Will save. Success allows it to awaken immediately; failure means it remains asleep and trapped in the dream world. The victim automatically awakens after 8 hours if it is still alive.\n\nEach hour that the victim remains trapped in sleep by the nightmare creature, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A creature that has taken Charisma damage during its dream awakens fatigued and does not heal or regain spells as it normally would while resting. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by the night terrors dies.\n\nA wish or miracle spell or an antimagic field ends the effect and awakens the victim. A protection from evil spell blocks night terrors for its duration, but it does not awaken the creature. A dream spell used on the sleeping creature allows the victim a new save to break free of the effect, but the deliverer of the dream message must succeed on a Will save or be trapped in sleep with the nightmare creature ruling its dreams, just as though it were the original target of the night terrors. A blanket of silver links worth at least 2,000 gp prevents a nightmare creature from entering a creature&apos;s dreams so long as it in contact with the sleeping creature, but it has no effect if placed on a sleeping creature already embroiled in night terrors." compset="RaceSpec">

  <thing id="raABCrMnd" name="Created Mind" description="Clockwork creatures know nothing when first created, but many are intelligent. On its first day, a clockwork creature functions like any mindless construct, but thereafter its native intelligence comes to the fore, allowing it to reason and improvise. Creators can thus give their clockwork constructs somewhat vague commands and allow them to interpret and act on them, secure in the knowledge that their servants will not act in a way contrary to their desires.\n\nDespite a reasoning intelligence, the clockwork creature remains wholly under the control of its creator and does nothing against that individual&apos;s will. Because of a special bond formed during its first day, the clockwork creature can instinctively detect the location of its creator, regardless of magical and natural barriers, so long as the latter is within 100 feet. This ability prevents anyone from successfully impersonating the creator within that range. If someone resembling its creator issues an order from more than 100 feet away, the clockwork creature might or might not obey, depending on how suspicious it is of the command.\n\nThe creator can designate another creature or group of creatures for the clockwork creature to obey, but the creator&apos;s commands always take precedence over those of other designated commanders. If the clockwork creature has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, it continuously watches designated commanders for signs that they are commanding it against its creator&apos;s intent. Should such a situation occur, the clockwork creature acts loyally instead. A clockwork creature with an Intelligence of 12 or higher automatically knows when its creator is being forced to act against his own wishes through mental control or other coercion, physical or mental. In such a case, the clockwork creature improvises a way to attain its creator&apos;s true goals without allowing harm to come to him. In the absence of any commands from its creator, a clockwork creature follows the last commands it received. If it knows its creator is dead, it attempts to achieve his goals to the best of its ability." compset="RaceSpec">
