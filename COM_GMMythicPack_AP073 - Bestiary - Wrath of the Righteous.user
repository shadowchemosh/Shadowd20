  <thing id="rCBXoveron" name="Demon Lord, Xoveron" description="Xoveron, the Horned Prince, is the demon lord of gargoyles, gluttony, and ruins. It is said that he can look out through the eyes of all stone gargoyles perched on roofs throughout the world, watching and waiting for cities to fall, that he might visit and feed on those left behind. Xoveron himself towers at a height of 25 feet, with a wingspan of just over 50 feet. When the Horned Prince moves, the sound of stone grinding on stone can be heard, as if the demon lord himself were composed not of flesh but of some unholy stone come to demonic life.\n\nXoveron is often accompanied by numerous vrolikai and ulkreth demons. Gargoyles of tremendous size often serve at the Horned Prince's whim, as do monsters with a reputation for hunger and gluttony, such as purple worms or man-eating animals. His realm on the Abyss is an immense, ruined city called Ghahazi, said to have been constructed over the eons by the Horned Prince, who plucked decaying districts and crumbling structures from dead cities across countless worlds.\n\n{b}Xoveron's Cult{/b}\nXoveron is traditionally worshiped by gargoyles, although as the Age of Lost Omens has drawn on, his worship among humanoids has been increasing steadily, particularly among bandits, brigands, gluttons, and those who dwell in blasted, apocalyptic regions such as the Worldwound and the Sodden Lands. In such regions, the landscapes of ruined cities and devastated skylines appeal to those who worship the Horned Prince; his cultists raise temples to their demonic patron there in caverns, on ruined rooftops, or within the skeletal frames of partially collapsed cathedrals to gods whose faith and worship alike have moved on. Defenestration is far and away the favored method of sacrifice for his cult.\n\nIn addition to gargoyles, the cult is particularly fond of and even subservient to the nabasu demons. Often, a cult of Xoveron seeks out a newly &#147;born&#148; nabasu and offers itself to the demon. Usually this means the demon takes a few of the cultists to feed on and demands the survivors seek out more victims on a regular basis, but in some cases the ravenous newborn nabasu simply consumes the entire cult. To the fanatic of Xoveron, though, such a fate is worth dying for.\n\nXoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned gray gargoyle skull that's missing its lower jaw. His favored weapon is the ranseur. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Earth, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Caves, Demon, Entropy, and Ferocity." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rCBHerne" name="Herne" description="For nearly a century, the Estrovian Forest has been haunted by stag-horned woodsfolk known as hernes. From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings. Some believe them to be the ghosts of hunters betrayed; others say they are fey spirits who guard the woods; and still other believe them to be fiends summoned by worshipers of the Old Faith. While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.\n\nHernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.\n\nHernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller-with their antlers adding another foot or so-and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe race of hernes has existed for less than 90 years. The first of their kind was Herne Vilhaur, a crusader from Andoran. Wounded by a stag and left for dead by his erstwhile companions, Herne was taken by the druids of the Estrovian Forest. They promised to mend his mortal wounds with their ancient magic, and in a way they did. They hanged him from a mighty oak, and placed on his brow the antlers of the sacred stag that Herne had killed. Then they called down the &#147;curse of the winterthorn&#148; upon Herne, restoring his vitality but tying him forever to the spirits of the forest.\n\nThe druids intended to use the transformed Herne as an instrument of vengeance against their enemies. Instead, he turned upon them. Stripped of his humanity, the reborn Herne thought only of vengeance against the allies who had abandoned him and the druids who had made him a monster. Unable or unwilling to leave the forest, he claimed it as his domain. He haunted it till the end of his days, hunting both animals and humanoids who dared to enter the woods. Herne did not kill all he chased; some he allowed to join his band. Recreating the ritual that transformed him, Herne called antlers from the heads of his new companions, thereby passing the curse of the winterthorn on to them.\n\nEven after the original Herne's passing, his progeny continued his legacy, even taking his name for their race. Hernes breed true, and most of those who now live were born with the curse rather than having it placed upon them. The hernes live off the bounty of the forest and protect it from those they deem unworthy of its gifts.\n\nSave for superficial details, the ritual by which a human can be turned into a herne appears to have been lost with the death of Herne himself. Yet whenever followers of the Old Faith or notorious bandits disappear, rumor quickly spreads that they have not died, but been brought into the fold of Herne's band.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nHernes are relatively few in number considering the vastness of the Estrovian Forest. Though quite capable of living alone for long stretches of time, hernes are not antisocial, and they meet regularly with others of their kind to pass along news and trade crafted goods. They stay together in groups only with a purpose, however, whether it's to raise a family or to hunt a great beast. The largest population of hernes can be found near the tree known as Herne's Oak-the tree from which Vilhaur was hanged, and under which his body is buried (along with, according to legend, a trove of funerary offerings).\n\nLike the druids before them, hernes are followers of the old ways, both in practical matters and in spirituality. As hunter-gatherers, hernes raise no crops, and have domesticated only animals useful for hunting-dogs, horses, and owls. Though they thrill at the chase, hernes never take more than they need. They build few structures. Most live in hidden caves that run beneath the Estrovian Forest. Hernes are most active at night; people living on the edge of the Estrovian Forest often attribute strange noises from the woods to the hernes' midnight hunts.\n\nThe hernes practice an ancient form of druidism known as the Green Faith. This religion was once the dominant religion of the northern reaches of Avistan. Over the centuries, however, it has been replaced by the worship of the gods of the Inner Sea region. The arrival of the crusaders, many of whom worship their own regional deities, has only accelerated the decline of the old ways. The hernes thus consider themselves protectors not just of the forest, but also of the spirits which reside there.\n\nHernes value self-sufficiency, and reject most useless hierarchies. They especially despise those who claim rulership by noble blood. This hatred is reinforced by tales of the druids' persecution by Mendevian rulers, and of the duplicity of the original Herne's so-called noble allies. While common folk may be allowed to hunt and gather from the edges of the forest, hernes are quick to turn the tables on the extravagant hunts hosted by the Mendevian elite and their crusader allies. In a few instances, hernes have even given advice and aid to brave outlaws in their fights against corrupt nobles.\n\nHernes take full advantage of their supernatural reputation when interacting with other humanoids- they know threats are more menacing when issued from the mouth of a deathless servant of nature. Though hernes are not fey creatures and not deathless, most humanoids can't deny the creatures' supernatural nature. Though many hernes remain cold to other humanoids, some invite the dispossessed to join their bands. Those who accept the herne's offer cannot return to the life they once knew. To the superstitious folk of Mendev, swearing allegiance to a herne is tantamount to signing a deal with a devil; such folk are forever beyond the pale.\n\nAs warriors have returned to their homelands from the Mendevian Crusades, they have brought with them many stories, including that of Herne Vilhaur and his accursed progeny. Reported sightings of hernes in forests far south of Mendev are easy to dismiss as the imaginings of those who have fallen for these fanciful tales, yet some who know of the hernes suspect they may be expanding their territory." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBSinSeek" name="Sin Seeker" description="Believed to have been bred centuries ago by zealous priests and inquisitors, sin seekers are living creatures with a supernatural ability to detect the scent of varying degrees of morality. Originally small forest swine known for their acute senses of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests' goal was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of rival faiths, identifying them by their hidden sins.\n\nIn the centuries following their initial creation, various sects throughout Golarion maintained small sin seeker breeding programs. Many of these were aimed at culling impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many evil sects used sin seekers as torture and interrogation aids. Today, small populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion, and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCenturies of selective breeding have improved the sin seekers' magical abilities, granting them the ability to sense other creatures' motives and alignments. They are capable of instantly sensing whether a creature is good or evil, and they also have a knack for tracking creatures by their auras. Once in close contact with a creature, sin seekers have a host of tools for discerning whether that creature is lying or manipulating information. In addition to the aura of honesty that surrounds them, each seeker has a small arsenal of spell-like abilities that help it glean the truth from weak-willed creatures.\n\nThough graced with an above-average intelligence, sin seekers are poor at handling logistics and practicalities. They make excellent judges of character, and easily pick up on subtle social cues that could indicate dishonesty. While sin seekers are able to draw distinctions between various motives, they have no inherent alignment, and don't place moral judgments on the information they gather. Like bloodhounds sniffing for a trail, sin seekers happily delve for information without regard for what it means. This moral ambivalence makes them equally useful for benevolent or malicious purposes.\n\nSin seekers lack any natural instincts and rely entirely on reciprocal relationships with larger creatures for protection and sustenance. Sin seekers are omnivores who can survive on almost any kind of food, though they are healthiest when fed a vegetable-heavy diet. They can eat anything, but they're poor at regulating their own nutrition-if left to their own devices, sin seekers gorge themselves to the point of nausea, especially when offered rich, fatty foods. While they acclimate quickly to new cultures and eating habits, they are susceptible to unfamiliar diseases and poisons.\n\nThough sin seekers can be found throughout Golarion, they are best suited for the moderate climates of the Inner Sea region, northern Casmaron, and coastal Tian Xia. While their small frames are well padded by a layer of fat, they are mostly hairless and lack sufficient body mass to survive frigid temperatures for long. They fare no better in extreme heat, as they easily become dehydrated and are vulnerable to sunburn. Luckily, their susceptibility to the elements is counterbalanced by their suitability for indoor living. Despite their porcine aspect, they live cleanly, and can easily be trained to use lavatories. They have an inherent respect for personal space and are happiest when provided with a small nesting area to call their own. Sin seekers are quiet living companions, except during mating season, during which time they utter grotesque, mewling cries. In all, sin seekers are finicky creatures who require more upkeep than most animals, though their unique skill set makes them worth the extra effort.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSin seekers are wholly domestic creatures incapable of surviving long in the wild. Like any domestic animal, sin seekers are acclimated to humanoid contact, and integrate well into humanoid cultures. Though slightly repulsive in appearance, they are affectionate creatures with good social skills. Unfortunately, their inability to properly defend themselves and inability to regulate their eating make them high-maintenance travel companions, especially when contrasted with self-sufficient familiars like cats, monkeys, and rodents. Sin seekers are easy prey, and their sightlessness makes them especially vulnerable to quick predators such as hawks, wolves, and foxes. Sin seeker familiars require constant guardianship and physical protection.\n\nThe difficulty of keeping such delicate creatures alive and healthy has often proven worth the trouble for religious sects throughout Golarion. While each sect breeds its sin seekers with different magical abilities, they all use the creatures as lie detectors and moral litmus tests. Clergy from good-aligned sects, like those that worship Iomedae or Sarenrae, often use sin seekers as penitential aids. These sects see sin seekers as living reminders of the priests' shortcomings and often use them to witness ritual oaths. Evil sects, like those that worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, often use sin seekers as interrogation and inquisitional instruments. Such sects combine the use of sin seekers with traditional torture techniques to persecute nonbelievers or to weed out seditious forces within their ranks.\n\nOnce trained, sin seekers make excellent familiars, and form strong bonds with their keepers. They are both affectionate and loyal, and quickly adopt their keepers' personalities. Their high intelligence and lie-detecting abilities make them favored familiars of detectives, interrogators, and negotiators. Sin seekers' ability to track creatures by following their auras make them popular among rangers, paladins, and inquisitors who specialize in tracking evil creatures. Unfortunately, while sin seekers are incredibly useful, their auras of honesty and repulsive appearances can sometimes be a hindrance to adventuring parties. Charismatic rogues and bards find the creatures both off-putting and inconvenient. Any character of 5th level or higher with the Improved Familiar feat may take a sin seeker as a familiar.\n\n{b}Variant Sin Seekers{/b}\nWhile the description above represents the most common variant of sin seekers, some sects breed the creatures with abilities that more closely align with their religious aims. Sin seekers from good-aligned temples often have the ability to cast {i}protection from evil{/i} instead of {i}confess{/i}. Congregations that revile the undead sometimes breed their seekers to cast {i}detect undead{/i} instead of {i}zone of truth{/i}, or {i}speak with dead{/i} instead of {i}comprehend languages{/i}. Evil sects, meanwhile, sometimes breed into their sin seekers the ability to cast {i}interrogation{/i} instead of {i}seek thoughts{/i}, or {i}touch of idiocy{/i} instead of {i}comprehend languages{/i}." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBThoxel" name="Demon, Thoxel" description=" Able to take the shape of rank-and-file soldiers and infect military ranks like a cancer, thoxels-also known as insubordination demons-spend every drop of their malice to break down the cooperative spirit of those who fight together. Among mortal soldiers, thoxels whisper disparaging words about commanders, talk in hushed tones about the danger of upcoming battles, or belittle other soldiers' accomplishments. Many great battles are said to have been lost because of the presence of these subtle but murderous demons within an army's ranks. They represent a passion to kill as they please without caring about order, control, or their allies. Despite their skill at martial exploits, thoxels are lazy and untrustworthy creatures. Thoxel demons are 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThoxel demons form from the souls of deserters and traitors, those who abandoned their posts and their erstwhile allies to their fates while they sought glory elsewhere on the battlefield, or safety far from it. These cowardly demons delight in breaking the spirits of those they hide among, disguised as typical soldiers. Their defining sin is the ruin, pain, and death they brought to others by failing to follow orders, keep discipline, and stand firm in face of adversity. It is not just that they failed private tests of character, but also that their moral disintegration led to great suffering in others who trusted them and depended on them. Those betrayers who sought to expiate their guilt through reconciliation and reparations to those they abandoned still earned their shame but preserved their eternal souls, but the unrepentant souls who callously disregarded the tragedies left in their wake, hewing to their own path again and again despite the havoc they left behind, often find their way to the Abyss.\n\nThoxel demons are lazy in the extreme, prone to shirking labor and sleeping whenever they have the chance-despite not needing to do so. Thoxels usually have to be herded into work details and closely supervised by more powerful demons. When closely directed, they can perform impressively in battlefield maneuvers and move with tight precision, coordinating their attacks between one another in order to bring down lone prey too strong for a single thoxel to defeat on its own. Once their prey is taken or the enemy's resolve is broken, their temporary alliances fracture quickly and they resort to squabbling and fighting among themselves over the spoils, with the strongest taking the lion's share and the rest settling for scraps.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThoxel demons are instruments of spiritual torture, in that they represent the advent of hope followed by its shattering destruction. They appear to be strong and steadfast warriors who march in precise formation and keep their armaments perpetually polished to a parade ground shine, yet at precisely the wrong moment they break and run, or disrupt careful formations with sudden and unexpected maneuvers aimed at self-aggrandizement or self-preservation. They corrode discipline and morale, turning troops against commanders and allies against friends. Thoxels are agents of dissension and disruption, whether working alone or using magical or mundane disguises to infiltrate existing units.\n\nThoxels are reborn into bodies very much like the ones they possessed in life, though they are scarred and physically tormented for their cowardice and treachery in life before being reborn into an eternity of spreading their sin to others. They are formed up into squads and platoons and set to patrol the endless realms of the Abyss when not sent to break armies on the Material Plane. These groups of thoxels form fluid ranks, gathering together for short periods of time interspersed with long periods of lazy rest.\n\nThough thoxels willingly fight for any demons more powerful than themselves, they are common within the Abyssal realm of Charnelhome, where the psychic implements of Shax dissect and dismember soul and spirit as surely as they do flesh and bone. There, thoxels spar continuously with the babaus and chokers who lurk in every shadowy corner of Charnelhome, fighting a guerrilla war to show who are the fittest servants of the Blood Marquis.\n\nThoxel demons are skilled artisans, able to forge and maintain weapons and armor of excellent quality, and they take a certain pride in ensuring their personal armaments are always sharp and in good repair. When closely supervised, thoxel demons can be tasked with forge duty, turning out weapons for demonic legions in great numbers. However, their selfishness and laziness impairs their usefulness as foundry smiths for demon armies, as they frequently take shortcuts to get through their quotas and care little for the fate of demonic soldiers whose weapons shatter in battle or whose armor is ill-fitting or missing key fasteners. Anyone who relies on an insubordination demon's craftsmanship takes a great risk, for thoxels rarely put much care and attention to detail into the armor or weapons that are intended for anyone but themselves." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBVescaQu" name="Vescavor Queen" description="Appearing as an amalgam of frightening vermin, a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, with its insectile wings and bloated body being the most innocuous aspects. Not only is a queen's bite stronger than that of its spawn, the queen can also spit the acid in its mouth at opponents. Its arms don't end in hands, but in scything claws poised to rend through flesh and armor. A vescavor queen is roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly 500 pounds- more when carrying a brood.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nVescavor queens are creatures of the Abyss through and through; no lesser vescavor embodies the chaotic nature of the plane as thoroughly. Even after passing through the threshold between planes, a vescavor queen retains this infusion of pure chaos, exuding anarchic energies from within and using this attunement to invigorate itself and its kin. And just like its spawn, a vescavor queen trills a mind-muddling song of the Abyss-an incomprehensible and nonsensical mashing of notes and sounds that befuddles those who hear it.\n\nThough queens by name, vescavors are genderless creatures that got their name simply for their ability to birth vescavor swarms. With no desires beyond the base instincts of devouring and destroying, vescavor queens start out as the last remaining members of their swarms, having eaten more than any others in the group-and having devoured other members of the swarm-in blind hunger. It is unknown what causes vescavors to grow within the queen, but some scholars believe that the way the creatures are born from the remnants of the vescavors and other materials is a biological representation of how the Abyss constantly consumes and recycles itself.\n\nAside from the obvious offensive benefits a vescavor queen's acid gland imparts to it, this gland is thought to be a way for the vescavor queen to break down more durable materials for consumption. Vescavor queens also develop abilities that allow them to control their brood swarms and ignore the swarms' constant gibbering and biting. Vescavor swarms are birthed from a leathery, cocoon-like egg sac that the young vescavors eat through in order to break into the world.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nVescavors are native to the darkest corners of the deepest reaches of the Abyss. However, with the opening of the Worldwound, they are no longer relegated to the dark and twisted recesses of that realm. Even so, once through the rift between planes, many vescavors don't travel very far, instead setting up their hives in the Worldwound. To date, no vescavors have been reported more than 100 miles from the border of the Worldwound, though nothing stops their spread like the wardstones do the demons. It is their own complacency and desire for familiar surroundings that keep them in this region and prevent them from spreading far and wide.\n\nA single queen presides over a region or nest, with all the swarms in the area falling into its brood, whether or not it actually birthed them. Becoming a vescavor queen relies not on ambition or work-such concepts are alien to vescavors' nature-but on instinct and chance. When a queen dies, vescavors notice the sudden lack of a source of chaos and then disperse. Some nearby swarms move in to feed on the remnants of the queen. The vescavor that consumes the most material from the queen's corpse takes over the mantle as queen, growing into its new size and developing its enhanced abilities within a week.\n\nWhether queen for a day or a decade, the vescavor queen is never challenged by vescavor swarms. As long as there is something to eat (which for a vescavor swarm means anything but adamantine), vescavors are content engines of destruction. A vescavor queen's ability to heal other vescavors solidifies its unshakable rule.\n\nBeing creatures of the Abyss, vescavors can live in nearly any environment, though they often choose areas that are environmentally similar to their natural habitat if they find themselves on the Material Plane. As such, they often make their homes underground or in natural caves, where the darkness suits them. They might even burrow their own tunnels and caves underground if nothing natural suits their preferences. As with the chaos they embody, there is no rhyme or reason to the designs of their self-made lairs-they follow whereever their mouths lead them.\n\nA vescavor queen holds off producing new swarms until it has a proper nest. The standard gestation period for a new swarm is roughly 3 weeks, at the end of which the queen lays an egg sac. Though vescavors don't strictly need to eat to survive, their ravenous desire to consume, as well as how readily available and abundant a food source is, can alter the gestation period. Scarce resources can delay hatching from 3 to 4 weeks, or vast quantities of food can hasten the birthing process to a single week between hatchings. Vescavor queens remaining in the Abyss spawn new vescavors at different and completely random intervals, independent of location or availability of edible material." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBSifkesh" name="Demon Lord, Sifkesh" description="Sifkesh, the Sacred Whore, is the demon lord of suicide, heresy, and hopeless despair. She rules the Abyssal realm of Vantian, the legendary City of Open Windows. The city itself is constantly destroying itself, as its buildings continually plummet into the churning surf along an eternally crumbling coastline.\n\nSifkesh is among the most enigmatic of all demon lords, for she seems more diabolic or even daemonic in her personality and appearance. Planar scholars have long struggled to interpret the demon lord's position and power. The belief that Sifkesh rose from the animus of a heretical erinyes who became the first of Hell's heretics is correct, and she constantly works to seduce and lure additional powerful devils from their infernal roles, inviting some to join her as favored minions but leaving others in place so they can more easily work to subvert Hell's machinations.\n\n{b}Sifkesh's Cult{/b}\nSifkesh is worshiped by blasphemers, heretics, outcasts from other religions, and survivors of botched suicide attempts. Her faithful are relatively solitary individuals, and there isn't a strong element of group worship of the demon lord-her cults tend to be small and often amount to only a single worshiper who might employ or rule his own group of minions or followers who don't actually serve the Sacred Whore. Worship of Sifkesh is a deeply personal and secretive thing, and many of her followers publicly belong to other religions, worshiping the demon lord of heresy in secret as they work to undermine the faith their allies and companions believe them to have. Holy sites to Sifkesh include desecrated churches, haunted houses, and towers with too many windows-nearly always, such temples and shrines to Sifkesh are empty and abandoned. The lone worshiper might share the site with other creatures such as predators or undead, and may even rely upon the presence of such creatures as convenient protection and defense against the enemy.\n\nSifkesh's unholy symbol is a pair of feminine hands crossed at slashed wrists. Her favored weapon is the war razor. She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Demon, Loss, and Nightmare (even though she normally wouldn't be able to grant access to the subdomain of Loss, she can do so due to her close associations with despair and hopelessness)." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rCBDrochaS" name="Drocha Swarm" description="The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.\n\nMostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nIt is postulated drocha swarms can form anywhere death has occurred on a massive scale. Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually nonexistent in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating them from the Inner Sea.\n\nThe dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful, and attack any living thing near them with impunity.\n\nSince these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing. Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling, for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown no hint of letting up.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nDrocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast, some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible for their demise.\n\nBecause of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's existence-which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living things.\n\nOn rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more) swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them, though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens, the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens in these rare circumstances is unknown.\n\nTo the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is anyone's guess." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBFallen" name="Fallen" description="The fallen were once sworn champions of the previous four crusades against the Worldwound to whom fate has perpetrated a cruel trick. Unable to receive Pharasma's judgment and receive whatever reward awaits them in the afterlife for the deeds they performed in life, they are the grim, ghostly remains of the men and women they once were. However, the fallen's original goal of valiantly marching into the Worldwound to save Golarion from the demonic tide has washed from their tortured minds, and is replaced instead by pain, sorrow, and hatred. Their fall in battle remains the greatest disappointment in their souls. Most fallen are still adorned in the battered and breached armor they died in and armed with the weapons they once carried into battle. Sentient and suffering, the fallen wander the Worldwound in search someone to end their misery by performing last rites.\n\nAt a glance, a fallen might be mistaken for a wellarmed ghost or spectre, but even casual study reveals that their fiery eyes are not vacant, and they're anything but mindless. In battle, fallen move in an efficient and deliberate manner, and they are absolutely silent until they deign to speak in raspy, sepulchral tones.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nUpon death, a soul normally enters the Great Beyond and travels to the Boneyard, and once there, travels to an appropriate Outer Plane to become a petitioner. Whatever fate befalls that petitioner, whether it is destroyed or its energies are released to create an outsider, it never returns to the Boneyard again. Spiritualists speculate that the Abyssal energies pervasive throughout the Worldwound have altered the planar structure of the region in such a way that in very rare cases, typically among the strongwilled, some souls instinctively react as if were on an Outer Plane already and never depart for the Boneyard. These are the fallen.\n\nThe fallen are spontaneously created, and are similar to ghosts but for one crucial difference-the fallen have no remaining unfinished business to tie them to the Material Plane aside from receiving a proper burial. Like many other types of undead, the fallen have an aversion to sunlight. They are incapable of becoming corporeal, but can open and close doors, hurl objects, and otherwise manifest their displeasure through the use of telekinesis, and their ghostly weapons still strike true and deal damage since they are made of force. A fallen can even shroud itself in darkness so tangible that most demons cannot penetrate it. When funeral rites are conducted upon the place where they died, the infusion of positive energy scours away the Abyssal taint. This localized restoration of the natural cosmological order allows the soul of the fallen to escape to the Great Beyond and thus receive judgment.\n\nThough they were crusaders in life, fallen typically avoid the demons of the Worldwound unless they happen upon an injured or distracted one. Their shame at dying by demonic claws and their tortured existence hinders their ability to strike at the demons in their current state. When fallen encounter mortals, they typically plead for release from their condition through burial. They don't give the mortals much time to decide for themselves, instead using their abilities to compel the mortals into service-or slaying them in anger and frustration.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThe fallen desire nothing but release from the Material Plane. Existence is agony and horror for the fallen, a state that they cannot end themselves. They are not evil for evil's sake, but their situation fills them with uncontrollable rage and they cannot help but resent the living and act selfishly to end their plight. Some fallen lie to would-be rescuers, promising to reveal great treasure near the place they died. Others attack outright if not helped, take hostages, or threaten reprisals against family members or other innocents. That the Worldwound is too dangerous for most adventurers is inconsequential to them-for when did the fallen ever waver when duty called? Some simply go mad and cannot be reasoned with. The most tragic and desperate of the fallen are those that cannot remember where they died.\n\nTheir dark nature notwithstanding, the fallen understand enough about the reality of their situation to call upon clerics and paladins to help them. They can manage to hold back their rage in these situations and refrain from attacking the one who can help end their plight, but this doesn't stop them from attacking a cleric's companions. Likewise, the fallen do not hinder those affected by their curse of the unburied ability." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBCambion" name="Demon, Cambion" description="Not all demons are formed from the sinful souls of mortals sent on to the Abyss. Demons are nothing if not fecund, as the widespread presence of tieflings, halffiends, and fiendish creatures attests, yet these tainted and corrupted spawn are not true demons. Cambions are unusual fiends in that they merge these two methods of demonic creation, resulting in a nearly humanoid but wholly fiendish creature capable of rising to great heights of power in time.\n\nA cambion is in small part a humanoid, but in practice this aspect applies almost entirely to his physical appearance, for a cambion is a true outsider, a creature whose body and soul are one. The majority of cambions have red skin, horns on their heads, and cloven hooves for feet-while the same variety exists among cambions as it does among humans, the fiendish aspects of cambions' appearance don't range as widely as those of tieflings. A typical cambion stands 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA cambion is born when an incubus impregnates a humanoid female in the Abyss and the humanoid carries the child to term without leaving the Abyss. While gestating, the child absorbs the plane's chaotic evil energies and transforms completely. Rather than being a half-fiend (as would be the case if the mother gave birth or was impregnated on a plane other than the Abyss), a child born under such circumstances is always born a cambion, and always born male. Only humanoids can give birth to cambions, and the majority of cambions' mothers are humans. Birthing a cambion is particularly painful and dangerous, and in most cases the mother dies during childbirth.\n\nCambions are unusual among demons in that they enter life in the Abyss not as fully formed demons, but as infants. And while cambions mature quickly-reaching adulthood over the course of only 6 painful months- they remain relatively helpless for much of this time, requiring someone to rear them. The Abyss's denizens are not known for their caring and nurturing natures, so despite the insatiable urges of their incubus fathers, few cambions live to see adulthood. And while cambions do not need to remain in the Abyss during the period of their maturation, it's rare for someone to spirit such a child out of the Worldwound.\n\nOnce fully grown, a cambion attains its full demonic powers. When the first day of its seventh month of life dawns, a cambion gains his spell-like abilities and sinfrenzy power. Unlike other demons, cambions as a whole aren't associated with a specific sin; some revel in their fathers' lustful natures, and other embrace pride, envy, and so on (this need not match their sinfrenzies).\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Soceity{/b}\nFew places in the Abyss provide safe harbor for a newborn cambion to mature-the most notable of these are Nocticula's Midnight Isles. Here, Nocticula rewards those who take upon themselves the stewardship of a cambion infant, but only if that cambion, upon reaching maturity, chooses to award its foster parent the honor of being named its &#147;warden.&#148; A cambion has a month to bestow this honor, and does so by uttering the following prayer to Nocticula: &#147;By the grace of Our Lady in Shadow do I name thee, (creature's name), my warden.&#148; By Nocticula's decree, cambions are free to name anyone warden, so anyone who seeks this honor is well advised to give her cambion fosterling no reasons to betray her.\n\nOnce a warden is so chosen, the nature of the boon Nocticula grants varies; it might be a monetary reward, a magical gift, an enhancement to body or mind, or (in rare cases) even a moment of dalliance with Nocticula herself. Entire societies on the Midnight Isles exist for the sole purpose of raising cambions and seeking out such boons.\n\nCambions often rise to great power by advancing in class level, particularly in classes associated with their favorite sins. It is rare for a cambion to take class levels in a class that is not associated with its sinfrenzy ability, but not unheard of.\n\nWhen encountered on the Material Plane, cambions most often already have a number of class levels. These cambions are in charge of groups of cultists, where they serve as demonic generals and powerful spellcasters. They always come to the Material Plane with grand plots and recruit others to help them sow sin. Cambions in these roles are often in service of a demon lord-or even Lamashtu herself. It is unusual for more than a handful of cambions to work together, as their inflated egos lead to arguments and internal bickering." compset="Race">

Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a cambion can turn himself over to his sin and enter into a frenzied state as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack rolls.

While an envious cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his channeled energy effect increases by 1d6.\n\nGluttony (alchemist): Cambion alchemists take great pleasure in drinking their extracts, potions, mutagens, and even poisons. While a gluttonous cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his bombs deal an additional die of damage.\n\nGreed (rogue): Cambion rogues are obsessed with gathering as much wealth and power as they can.

While a lustful cambion bard is in a sinfrenzy, the effects of his inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of the cambion's bardic performances also increase by 1 when he is in this state.\n\nPride (wizard): Cambion wizards believe their magic is greater than all others. While a prideful cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his spell save DCs increase by 1.\n\nSloth (fighter): Cambion fighters carry the essence of sloth within, so much so that even their very blood seems to flow slowly from cut veins. While a slothful cambion fighter is in a sinfrenzy, he gains 2 bonus hit points per Hit Die.\n\nWrath (ranger): Cambion rangers charge their attacks with savage hatred.

Having been the first succubus and then having ascended to become a demigoddess, Nocticula now sets her eyes at a greater prize-full divinity. Lamashtu is the only demon lord who has accomplished this task so far, but Nocticula aims to be the second. What kind of deity she might become is anyone's guess-some believe that Nocticula is secretly seeking redemption from her demonic nature. Others say these rumors were seeded by Nocticula herself as a grand lie to distract her enemies from her true goal of becoming an assassin and seducer of gods.\n\nNocticula is certainly mercurial in her personality and attitude. She may simply murder or enslave visitors to her realm, or she may welcome them with open arms-even those who one would think were her enemies. Only a fool accepts her invitation without suspicion, for what the queen of succubi wants may change dramatically from one moment to the next.\n\n{b}Nocticula's Cult{/b}\nNocticula is worshiped by assassins, the lustful, whores, shadow-using creatures, and of course succubi. These worshipers form relatively small cults, often akin to secret societies, that use brothels, nobility, or academies as a cover for their true purposes. A small number of heretics venerate her as well, not as a demigoddess of murder and lust but as one of outcasts, artists, and the glories of midnight. The fact that such heretical clerics are granted spells as surely as the rest of her worshipers has caused not a small amount of discontent among her faithful, which Nocticula seems to enjoy.\n\nNocticula's symbol is a multi-pointed crown wrapped with thorny vines.

  <thing id="rCBLamhigy" name="Lamhigyn" description="Simple creatures, lamhigyns emerged from the chaotic fabric of the Abyss. Abyssal pests might be a good description of these strange creatures; their stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated, opportune victims for the Abyss's insatiable predators. Viewing intruders with evil disdain, lamhigyns are always looking for new victims, which they slowly lap apart, piece by piece, with their rasping mouths.\n\nLamhigyns are strange-looking creatures that are often characterized by mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown, flying tadpoles with the wings of a bat and a stinger-tipped tail. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near rifts to their homeland. Their bulbous, unblinking eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the first and last things unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are fond of wrapping their wings around their victims' heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick tongues that flicker when intruders arrive.\n\nLamhigyns have thick, scaly skin on their bodies ranging in color from red to green. Though lamhigyns are typically encountered flying, on the ground they stand on four insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high, 8-pound bodies pack an impressive punch when hurtling through the air at their victims.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLamhigyns are pests from another plane and have no proper place in the Material Plane's natural order. Chaotic creatures with an inherent streak of evil, they lie in wait, eager for mortal life to happen by. When this occurs, lamhigyns instantly attack and try to immobilize their victims before slowly devouring them alive.\n\nLamhigyns that have slipped through to the Material Plane breed in dark caves and shadowed forests. Their mating rituals are dangerous, messy affairs. Approximately once every year, the fertile females- which are nearly indistinguishable from the males- fly to the highest corners of the cave or den where they live. There, they squawk uncontrollably. The males hurtle toward these females; the ensuing flapping and screeching results in the females' three or five eggs becoming fertilized. The females then lay these eggs in slime-covered clusters, where they incubate for 6 to 8 weeks before hatching. Lamhigyn mothers typically die shortly after laying their eggs, their bodies exhausted by the violent process of reproduction.\n\nAs they grow, lamhigyn hatchlings join any others of their kind in nearby caverns or find their own comfortable, dark places in which to live. Some find the Material Plane uncomfortable and spend all of their energy trying to find a way back to the home world they've never known but feel intrinsically drawn to.\n\nBeing from the Abyss, lamhigyns do not need to sleep; however, many choose to stay very still within the darkness-their wings wrapped around their bodies and their tiny legs curled underneath-waiting for the simple pleasure of scaring anything that may wander nearby. Similarly, lamhigyns have no need or desire to eat, but they spend much of their energy focused on predation. Though they don't require sustenance, they delight in bloodshed and violence.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFound in all corners of the Abyss, lamhigyns often slip through to the Material Plane (or other planes in the Great Beyond) as a result of being caught up by portals or flying too close to a rift between worlds. The greatest known rift on Golarion is the Worldwound. Here, lamhigyns are found in great abundance, almost invariably in caves, cliffs, or even the fabric of the Worldwound itself-sites chosen because of their similarity to lamhigyns' darkened homes in the Abyss. In fact, some of these simple-minded creatures believe this region of Golarion is part of the Abyss. For the most part, however, they're more delighted with the abundance of food in the Worldwound than they are concerned with geography.\n\nWhen it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be volatile and violent in nature. In general, they tend to get along with other lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off: living in too close proximity to each other, mating disputes, or arguments over the torn bodies of victims. When this happens, lamhigyns turn the full force of their chaotic fury onto each other, tearing and grappling until only one-sometimes none-of the bizarre creatures remain. When lamhigyns turn against each other, they are even more vicious than when they attack other creatures. Sometimes a petty squabble between two boisterous lamhigyns can spread through an entire hive as they infect each other with a chaotic bloodlust. Before long, entire caverns full of lamhigyns erupt in screeching echoes that crash against the rocky walls.\n\nWhen they're not fighting among themselves, lamhigyns occupy shared spaces in noisy, flapping hives, waiting for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. Intelligent creatures susceptible to fear-such as adventurers, creatures whose minds have been warped by the Worldwound's infestations, or unlucky natives- then suffer lamhigyns' gleeful ire. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown bored. When it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously terrified reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love more than to tear the life from terrified, screaming humans while they are out of their minds with fear.\n\nLamhigyns fill parts of the Abyss like pigeons fill large cities, and many demons regard the creatures as terrible pests. Some demons take to hunting the creatures for target practice or pest control. Lamhigyns avoid most demons, especially those more powerful than dretches. They enjoy harassing dretches and quasits, however, and often flock around individuals, screeching and battering them with their wings. This hazing goes both ways, and in the Abyss dretch hunting parties scour caverns for lamhigyns.\n\nUnlike many other creatures, lamhigyns show little racial preference between a solitary existence or one with others of their kind. Although lamhigyns are more potent in groups, a single lamhigyn might occupy a small cave near the Worldwound for generations, waiting patiently for just one victim. Lamhigyns can live to be nearly 500 years old, though most die through acts of violence before reaching half that age.\n\nWhen the Worldwound first opened, lamhigyns poured through the tear in reality along with the demons. They were also some of the first to die, as the Sarkorians could defeat the strange, small creatures in combat more easily than they could the more durable demons. However, the winged creatures kept pouring through, foreshadowing the Abyssal onslaught that was to come. In short time, lamhigyns began populating the region, and now tens of thousands of these creatures are said to live near the Worldwound alone. Though lamhigyns are rare outside the Worldwound, their appearance elsewhere on Golarion is a sign that chaos-and the pain of draining, pesky stings-is sure to follow" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBOzPutrd" name="Ooze, Putrid" description="Putrid oozes are primarily made from organic mire animated with Abyssal energies. While these creatures can exist near any rift or portal, they're most plentiful in the Worldwound. These oozes have become more of a threat in recent years, caustically burning through any plants or animals in sight in pursuit of their vicious, though mindless, hunger. Putrid oozes especially are known for their ability to subsume creatures into their own gelatinous bodies once they have destroyed their victims. Putrid oozes generally are a combination of churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to chunky tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold undigested portions of the creatures they consume. At any one time, they present a mixture of rotting limbs, severed heads, and entangled entrails among the miscellaneous sludge that makes up their bodies. A putrid ooze typically covers an area that measures 12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a height of no more than 8 feet. A putrid ooze weighs about 20 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nPutrid oozes terrorize the Worldwound region, presenting yet another danger to those brave enough to face the demonic hordes.\n\nHow putrid oozes went from caustic environmental hazards to roving, animated horrors is still unclear. Some believe that the same strange Abyssal power that ripped the Worldwound into the face of Golarion slowly leaked into putrid oozes, which already contained substances native to that chaotic realm. This bizarre power imbued these oozes with a fundamental need to destroy and consume all plants and creatures in their paths. This explanation is as good as any-especially because it parallels the conscious desires of most Abyssal creatures, which seek the entropy and eventual destruction of all orderly existence. In this way, putrid oozes are like avatars of the power that seemingly gave them life.\n\nTo feed, putrid oozes physically roll over their victims, using their caustic bulk to break victims into easily digestible bits. They then churn these severed body parts and the other organic components of their prey throughout their sludge. For several days, the remnants of a putrid ooze's meal can easily be seen as it pulls its bulk across the ground, up walls, and even through water. Being resistant to acid, demons break down more slowly in a putrid ooze's body; it's not uncommon to find parts of clawed demon arms, horned heads, or spinecovered torsos churning around in a putrid ooze's bulk long after they were first consumed. Durable metals and stonework are also sometimes found suspended in these acidic creatures.\n\nMost hardy materials the putrid ooze consumes are never completely devoured. Eventually, putrid oozes break down their meals into the same gray-black, chunky morass that makes up their bodies. It's these ones that are considered most dangerous, for oozes that are empty are also hungry and aggressive. Although it's rare for a putrid ooze to starve-the Worldwound contains no shortage of slaughtered bodies and hapless crusaders-those weakening from hunger use the last of their dwindling energy to seek out chasms or ravines where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander past. In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near. Though the creatures are essentially in hibernation, all it takes is a simple touch to awaken them. In contrast, active putrid oozes are intimidating and disgusting sights to behold, something not likely to take someone by surprise.\n\nUnlike other oozes, putrid oozes do not reproduce via mitosis-splitting into two identical, smaller oozes. Instead, they form spontaneously from the corrupted rifts surrounding the Worldwound. Some cultists who revere Jubilex, demon lord of ooze monsters, have experimented with creating putrid oozes by creating disgusting slurries and exposing them to Abyssal rifts and foul energies. To date, the cultists have been unsuccessful in their endeavors, but the cult has captured half a dozen of these creatures for study. They see the spontaneous creation of these oozes as manifestations of their Faceless Lord.\n\nWhen putrid oozes are attacked and take enough damage to destroy them, they melt into an inert pool of muck as other oozes do, though whether putrid oozes eventually reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say that sunlight further breaks down putrid oozes once they are destroyed. Since the Worldwound has irregular patterns of daylight and even less sunlight, it is a relatively hospitable habitat for them. Regardless, because the Worldwound is seemingly growing at a steady rate, scholars believe these oozes will remain denizens of the region for generations to come.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nPutrid oozes inhabit most corners of the Worldwound region, particularly in areas that bear the strongest Abyssal influence. Being mindless and thus lacking any sort of culture, putrid oozes have no use for each other-or for any other creatures, for that matter, outside of their ability to serve as prey. In particularly isolated parts of the Worldwound, where wildlife is rarely encountered, putrid oozes turn on each other to eat. In these cases, the intense stench of sulfur and death emanating from the creatures-as well as any undigested food still churning away inside full oozes' bulk-draws other putrid oozes to one another. When putrid oozes feed on their own kind, they project narrow pseudopods into the bodies of their intended target in an attempt to fish out some half-digested food and draw it into their own bulk. Those who have studied these strange creatures note that the use of these pseudopods is exclusive to cannibalistic behavior.\n\nAmong the crusaders and other goodly souls who inhabit the Worldwound, putrid oozes are considered yet another affront to the free and natural beauty that was once Sarkoris. Many superstitious people consider putrid oozes instruments of the Abyss's destruction-evil blobs that seek to help the demons rule the region. The more rational-minded know that putrid oozes simply attack all living creatures with impunity, including wildlife, plants, demons, and crusaders alike.\n\nThose who have had the misfortune of encountering a putrid ooze and lived to tell about it warn all those who venture deep into the Worldwound to stay alert for the smell of sulfuric decay, the sound of gravel grating against bone, and the sight of suspiciously deep slurries and sludge; these are all signs of a nearby putrid ooze." compset="Race">

While this position is one that Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of influence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always, and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion, but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course, Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown.\n\nShamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rCBDemStri" name="Demodand, Stringy" description="Like all demodands, stringy demodands are devoted to serving their thanatotic titan masters in the Abyss. Stringy demodands fulfill this duty by serving as kidnappers, slavers, and slave masters throughout the Abyssal realms. Stringy demodands are physically well suited to this charge, being lankier, scrappier, and more agile than other demodands. Such agility allows a stringy demodand to quickly snatch up slaves-to-be and prevent slave revolts before they start. Taut muscles, wicked teeth, and sharp claws also make a stringy demodand a formidable fighter in the event of a struggle, and it should go without saying that a stringy demodand's defining feature-its hundreds of long, obscene ropes of skin-are ideal tools for easily binding and restricting its quarry.\n\nIt's the stringy demodands' long, obsidian-colored skin growths that give the abhorrent outsiders their name. These growths resemble nothing so much as elongated skin tags the girth of a human finger and roughly 4 feet in length. The fibrous outgrowths stretch from stringy demodands' heads to the tips of their batlike wings to their shins. These ropy villi bob and sway wildly as a stringy demodand moves, creating a truly disturbing image for those victims who dare to look back at their Abyssal pursuer.\n\nBecause these rubbery growths cover most of the creatures' bodies, they provide greater natural protection than the hides of other kinds of demodands and allow stringy demodands to eschew armor. Stringy demodands are typically 6 feet tall and weigh almost 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough all demodands are disgusting creatures, stringy demodands are among the most unnerving in terms of appearance. It's thought that when the thanatotic titans were sculpting the first stringy demodand, its waxen image drooped and melted from head to toe, forming the foul, stringy growths that now define these misbegotten monsters. Like the hairs of a human, these growths don't contain nerves yet grow at an incredible rate. When a stringy demodand loses these growths through carelessness or from wounds in battle, the fleshy strands rapidly regenerate. When at rest, stringy demodands wrap their ropy growths around their bodies like grotesque shawls. Some twist them around their lean torsos and intertwine the growths to produce elaborate headdresses of braided black skin.\n\nStringy demodands arise from fertilized demodand eggs just like all others of their kind. Since a given demodand's clutch produces a random distribution of different types of demodands, a stringy demodand's emergence cannot be planned. When a stringy demodand does happen to hatch from a demodand egg, it quickly savages the other eggs in the clutch to eliminate its competition. If it cannot ruin or consume the other eggs in its clutch before they hatch, a stringy demodand swiftly bullies its brethren into submission and proves itself to be the dominant sibling, establishing from birth its natural instinct to coerce and enslave.\n\nA stringy demodand's horrific appearance is often cause enough for potential victims to quake in their boots, but its unsightly aspect is far from the only feature that makes this being a formidable intimidator. In addition to its grotesque appendages and distasteful visage, a stringy demodand has a grating, alien voice that is simultaneously guttural and nasal. So terrible is its call that when it roars, a stringy demodand sends humans and demons alike scurrying for safety. Some say that when the thanatotic titans accidentally created the demodands and beheld their monstrous progeny for the first time, one of the titans let out a cry of anger and shock that shook the whole of the Abyssal realm. It's said that the stringy demodand heard his creator's shout and swallowed it hungrily, learning to scream like a god in so doing.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThough they prefer to work alone, stringy demodands grudgingly accept the company of other demodands when their thanatotic titan masters demand it. Stringy demodands' devotion to the titans is as fervent as that of any other among their kind, but these beings have the unusual tendency to take their masters' orders to the extreme, justifying any and all obscenities and collateral damage in the name of their Abyssal overlords. Such devotion can sometimes even lead stringy demodands to obliterate their demodand kin during missions should they see their brethren's efforts as lacking. Only shaggy demodands can deter stringy demodands' bloodlust with any consistency, as the latter realize that to attack their commanding brethren would be very foolish.\n\nAlways striving to please their masters, stringy demodands can be found on nearly every Abyssal realm capturing and enslaving future minions and playthings for thanatotic titans. When at rest, stringy demodands gather alongside other demodands to form enclaves of like-minded fiends so they can plot their next moves and calculate the most prime specimens to subjugate. In the Abyss, these victims are typically demons, the enslaved prisoners of these demons, and wandering mortals who happened into the Abyss at the wrong time. Though rarely encountered on the Material Plane, stringy demodands can sometimes be found as part of larger hunting parties tasked with capturing valuable mortals to bring back to their Abyssal realm.\n\nStringy demodands' loyalty and rashness make them well suited to serving as solitary slave masters, roles the thanatotic titans delight in having them serve. The demodands embrace this task with their typical overzealous fervor and happily bully, abuse, and torture their charges, often shattering slaves' minds as well as their bodies in the process. Although they understand that their thanatotic titan masters want as many mortal recruits as possible, it's sometimes difficult for the reckless stringy demodands to bring slaves to the titans without irreversibly breaking them first. Stringy demodands kill or violently maim more slaves than they successfully convert into the titans' faithful. This predilection for violence explains why, when stringy demodands take part in Abyssal slaving parties, they are usually accompanied by enough slimy and tarry demodands to keep their violent urges in check." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBVilstet" name="Demon, Vilsteth" description="Vilsteth demons, also known as corruption demons, are calved from the essence of the demon lord Baphomet's realm of the Ivory Labyrinth. Vilsteths form from the souls of corrupt and deceitful politicians, priests, and power brokers-those who in life abused and misused whatever ephemeral power they wielded. The defining sin of these souls was pride, fueled by vanity and a desire for adulation and ever-greater authority to be wielded in whatever selfish way they saw fit, coupled with a furious envy of anyone more beloved, respected, or feared than they. Vilsteths epitomize these traits, and can often be found lurking in monuments dedicated to important political figures or disguised within statues of prominent saints and heroes. In their natural form, vilsteths are over 7 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLike all demons, vilsteths aren't born in a biological sense. Instead, the souls of corrupt mortals find their way to Baphomet's Ivory Labyrinth after judgment, and in there gradually transform into these crooked beings. From their positions of power, the sinful souls that birth vilsteths manifested every kind of malfeasance, from pecuniary greed to self-indulgence of gluttony, sloth, and lust in life, but the common thread is always the arrogation of the self over the state or church or whatever organization upon which they presided, coupled with a narcissistic smugness that their pride and pleasures were of greater import than any other consideration. Of course, these sinful leaders' cynical pragmatism demanded that they keep their perverted proclivities secret, as they knew those beneath them would never understand, so each spun an ever-expanding labyrinth of lies to keep their corruption under cover. Some succeeded, living out their days shrouded in their sinister secrets; others failed spectacularly, leading to dissolution, schism, treason, social collapse, and revolution when the extent of the awful truth finally surfaced. Whether their sins were ever exposed, however, their corrupted pride and devious secrecy drew their souls into the Abyss and the Ivory Labyrinth of Baphomet, where they formed into vilsteth demons.\n\nVilsteths do not eat or drink in the usual sense. Their faces are like ivory masks-unmoving, impassive, and implacable, with only the glow of their amber eyes to mark their attention. Instead, they are emotional parasites, feeding on the reactions of others, sowing confusion and suffering and feasting upon the psychic residue that follows. Likewise, they do not speak with voices that humans might understand. Their communication is purely telepathic, from a subtle whisper to a psychic scream, echoing down the corridors of the minds of those to whom they &#147;speak&#148; and pushing them, whether gently or urgently, toward acts of sabotage, sedition, and sin of every kind.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCorruption demons are often solitary creatures who work independently on their schemes, though they sometimes summon lesser demons of like talents to further their pernicious agendas of subversion. They amass vast monetary wealth for common bribery and for lavish parties hosted by their minions in order to tempt and corrupt the unwary and the unwise. They encourage and inspire artists and sculptors to raise great monuments and masterworks for their own glory, and through these graven images they spy and speak and exercise a quiet dominion upon the great and small alike, working through prominent and respected leaders to delude the masses and subvert the common good.\n\nWhen vilsteths are encountered outside of the Abyss, these demons are often found in places where Baphomet's cults hold power. In rural areas, such cults may form around insular villages that have abandoned the traditional gods of hunt and harvest, trading them for a predatory faith hidden from the eyes of outsiders. In urban settlements, cultic cells and clandestine rites conducted behind masks and veils work together to suborn existing governmental, legal, and cultural authorities. Vilsteth demons may visit Baphomet's faithful in either milieu, acting as ambassadors and agents provocateur, often sitting in judgment of those who have violated the cult's confidentiality and helping to design and implement their agendas for anarchy and societal upheaval." compset="Race">

This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets.\n\nUnlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride.\n\nLabyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThe first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders.\n\nLabyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, &#147;How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye?&#148;).\n\nLabyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation-each is mystically connected to its mask.\n\nLabyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.\n\nWhen labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway.\n\nLabyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBBaphome" name="Demon Lord, Baphomet" description="Baphomet-Lord of the Minotaurs-was created by Lamashtu from the soul of the first minotaur. In those days, he was a powerfully muscled specimen, and the Queen of Demons kept him as a consort until the day Baphomet stole away from her palace in Yanaron, seeking to gain even greater favor by claiming a legendary trophy. Baphomet's ambition was as great as his folly, and he invaded the deepest layer of Hell, intent on stealing Asmodeus's ruby rod for his mistress. Needless to say, he was swiftly caught. Lamashtu claimed no allegiance to him, and Asmodeus imprisoned Baphomet in a devious maze the archdevil proclaimed to be unsolvable, even by the first minotaur. The archdevil also carved his own symbol into Baphomet's brow with the nail of his index finger in an attempt to fully subjugate the minotaur.\n\nBut in this attempt, it was Asmodeus who overstepped his bounds. Not only did Baphomet solve the seemingly unsolvable maze after a mere decade, but as he escaped, he also took the world-sized labyrinth with him. Baphomet had changed over that time, becoming almost emaciated in his build, yet growing much wiser. He did not return to Lamashtu's side, but instead took the archdevil's infernal maze and made it his own as he claimed a portion of the Abyss as his realm.\n\nThis was eons ago, and now Baphomet is a powerful demon lord in his own right. He has forgiven Lamashtu, and serves as her lover now and then, yet he's no longer her direct subservient minion. He works to increase the inf luence of his cult on countless worlds, building his forces so that one day he might again invade Hell. But this time, Baphomet plans on taking much more than Asmodeus's weapon-he intends to take Asmodeus's life!\n\n{b}Baphomet's Cult{/b}\nBaphomet is worshiped by conspirators, secret societies, corrupted crusaders, and above all else, minotaurs. His minotaur worshipers venerate him openly; in their art, Baphomet is typically depicted as a more classical bull-headed, minotaur-like creature, and when he deigns to appear before these worshipers he often assumes this form. His humanoid worshipers venerate him in secret, offering prayers and sacrifices in hidden shrines and dark temples beyond the sight of society and communicating in a complex series of hand gestures when in mixed company.\n\nBaphomet has two symbols. To most, including his minotaurs, his symbol is a brass minotaur's head with ruby eyes. His secret societies use this symbol as well, but also mark his works with the inverted pentagram, sometimes decorating the star shape with an image of his face. Baphomet's favored weapon is the glaive, although he does not abide any of his followers wielding a weapon that looks like Aizerghaul. He grants access to the domains of Animal, Chaos, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Demon, Ferocity, Fur, and Resolve." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rCBCorpLot" name="Corpse Lotus" description="A corpse lotus begins life as a small flowering plant that blooms near carrion, but given enough time, it can grow into an incredibly large and dangerous monstrosity. This terrifying plant possesses grasping vines capable of pummeling opponents before dragging them toward its beaklike maw. Always found where prey or corpses are abundant, corpse lotuses have been known to grow in dungeons, ruins, and battlefields in addition to more typical wooded locales.\n\nEvery corpse lotus has a single bulbous flower in its center, similar in shape to a lotus flower. The blossom's dark petals are streaked with blood-red pigment, and hide an acidic maw in their center. Corpse lotuses in different regions tend to resemble the dominant plant species in the surrounding area (with the exception of its distinct petals), thus granting the plants natural camouflage and enabling them to hide among the foliage. Their vines are thick and convulse violently when grasping at potential prey. Corpse lotuses gain their name from the garden of dead bodies that frequently surrounds the plant-typically animals or humanoids that strayed too close to the lotus. At rest, a corpse lotus can reach 8 feet in height and splay its leaves nearly 15 feet around.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nDespite being rooted in the ground, corpse lotuses are dangerous predators. While they derive sustenance from sunlight and water, their favored food is fresh meat, which provides enough nutrition for these plants to reach behemoth proportions. Any creature that wanders too near a corpse lotus risks being dragged in by the plant's vines toward its hungry center. The lotus's enormous, exotically patterned petals guard the flower's gaping maw, which is coated in a thick layer of acidic mucus to prevent prey from escaping. This mucus exudes a sweet, fruity aroma that attracts many kinds of animals toward the lotus.\n\nWhile the corpses that gradually pile up around a corpse lotus would normally eventually block out the plant's sweet odor, corpse lotuses emit a fine, supernatural mist that rolls along the ground around them and preserves their slain bounty. The mist has no color or aroma, and indeed can go completely unnoticed without the aid of magical detection. The anti-aging properties of this mist magically halt the process of decay on the collected corpses, leaving them in much the same state in which they died. Botanists and scholars have attempted to harness the powers of a corpse lotus's preserving mist for restorative elixirs and life-prolonging potions, but the strange vapors have proven useful only for embalming those already deceased.\n\nThe preserved corpses surrounding a corpse lotus also help to attract carrion feeders such as vultures, owls, and beetles to the hungry plant. Rather than decimating these flying scavengers, however, corpse lotuses have evolved to let aerial feeders pass, so that they may inadvertently consume corpse lotus seeds and redistribute them near and far. This is the corpse lotuses' primary means of reproduction. The fact that corpse lotuses of any kind-including the more mundane, miniature variety-can be used to pollinate corpse lotus seeds makes this form of reseeding particularly effective.\n\nA corpse lotus's single, large flower sprouts from a tangled mess of vines and roots near the center of the plant. The flower's petals are surprisingly thick and resilient, guarding the plant both from the elements and from anything that may struggle to escape its grasp. Its vast root system extends for almost 50 feet into the soil, making the plant extremely difficult to uproot, but thankfully also ensuring that the plant is immobile, other than its vines. While most of the vines that sprout from a corpse lotus are harmless and are merely used to transmit information about the plant's surroundings to the center blossom, four larger, much stronger vines extend from the flower and allow the lotus to manipulate corpses, snatch prey, and defend from attacks. These fibrous vines are roughly 10 inches thick, 25 feet long, and incredibly difficult to sever.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCorpse lotuses can be found in forests, jungles, and marshes the world over, though they thrive in wooded areas that are heavily populated or at least close to humanoid settlements. A corpse lotus's seeds are carried in the preserving mist that seeps from the plant's base. These seeds cling to any creatures that venture too near a corpse lotus, and given enough time create a fine film around fallen prey. Practiced adventurers can recognize this film as a telltale sign of a nearby corpse lotus." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBKatpask" name="Demon, Katpaskir" description="Katpaskirs are a pox and pestilence upon not just the world, but reality itself. Just as bugs burrow into unwatched crevices, katpaskirs pry their way into other realms and dimensions. They gnaw and scratch and grind away at the edges of the universe, the planar junctures where the folds of creation bend in upon themselves. They have an uncanny sense for finding natural rifts, portals, and convergences, and they seek ever for ways to expand and untether these natural gates. By setting them loose to drift across the world, they unhinge the orderly substrate of the multiverse, casting all into primordial chaos as the planes unravel. Their voices are strange and echoing, like several voices sounding together, each distorted and cacophonous and rising and falling asynchronously in pitch and volume. When not actively engaged in a task, katpaskirs tend to stand perfectly still, with the exception of its insectlike limbs, which rhythmically stroke the air in front of them. When other creature come near-or if some teleporting creature triggers the demon's warp sense special ability-it snaps out of this self-imposed stasis, ready to attack. Katpaskirs are a little over 7 feet tall and weigh just less than 600 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nKatpaskirs form in the Abyss from the souls of those apocalyptic preachers, doomsayers, and cult leaders who, not content to merely announce the end of days, took it upon themselves in life to bring a living hell to the realms where they resided. Some led suicide cults of dozens if not hundreds, while others organized ultraviolent gangs of nihilistic thugs, spouting cultured witticisms and philosophical sophistries while perpetrating the basest depravities. For them, the anarchic dissolution of society was only a harbinger of the very real disintegration of all that is.\n\nThese fiends are a natural fit for the armies of Deskari, and indeed, katpaskirs have been used by the Locust Lord for many eons as apocalyptic leaders and generals in his plane-spanning campaigns. Some of Deskari's most fervent and influential worshipers are known to have become katpaskirs in the afterlife, earning the powers of cataclysm and madness they so desperately sought while still mortal.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nExcept in unique circumstances that align with their goals, katpaskirs rarely interact with humanoid cultists of Deskari. In part, this is because their power makes them nigh uncontrollable even for the mightiest spellcaster, but also because these demons see little use in humanity and their ilk. To katpaskirs, mortals are part of the reality that must be destroyed, not the implements of its destruction. They may make brief use of humanoid minions, but at their earliest opportunity they devour and destroy those seeking to serve them, unleashing a horde of fiendish terrors to finish their mission of ultimate destruction. Crazed cultists of Deskari and powerful members of the Blackfire Adepts sometimes call upon katpaskirs to help the group create new portals to Deskari's Rasping Rifts or tear rifts between worlds, but such humanoids know that such a summoning ensures their own final reckoning as well.\n\nKatpaskirs are drawn to newly opened rifts and thin places between the planes. Upon reaching such areas, a katpaskir may either attempt to accelerate the opening of the rift or wait for whatever creatures come through once it opens." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBDevasta" name="Devastator" description="Terrifying, cruel machines forged from Abyssal steel, devastators are central figures in any demonic host's world-razing armies. These skyscraping metal goliaths are capable of driving the mad throngs of demons surrounding them to unthinkable feats of savagery and decimating even the mightiest of angelic choruses. In an unholy act of supreme irony, devastators derive their power from the souls of those goodly outsiders who fall in their attacks against the Abyss, and the war machines are capable of transforming virtue and piety into corrupt energy that fuels their fury. Few have witnessed these massive engines of unfettered chaos and destruction and lived to speak of the experience, but those few who have gazed into the maw of one of these metal monstrosities are forever changed.\nThese towering abominations hold a special place in the nightmares of holy champions and pure-hearted priests. Faith and the divine favors crusaders rely upon in order to squint into the evil gaze of demonkind affords them nothing against a devastator, which is capable of absorbing such divine energies for its own perverted use. Devastators stand 40 feet tall and weigh upwards of 40 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSaid to be one of the demon lord Haagenti's vile creations, devastators were built to serve as guardians and war machines for Abyssal hordes. Such a construction is no mere tower of metal, however, since the final step in the creation of a devastator calls for the battered body of an angel (or other powerful good outsider) whose spirit has been shattered and utterly corrupted. Such a fallen angel is kept on the brink of death as it is lashed to the devastator's dread frame, and when the engine is finally activated, any semblance of righteousness is forever drained from the defeated celestial's screaming spirit. In this way, a devastator's body acts as both a war machine and a brutal cage.\n\nA devastator is painstakingly crafted by hundreds of miserable fiendish dretches, and is wrought of strange metals and materials found in only the deepest, darkest realms of the Abyss. The angelic soul that fuels the construct is the inheritor of an existence of impotent rage, anguish, and humiliation. Some reports claim that the innards of a devastator are more murderous and gnashing than its fearsome exterior, and the unholy ministrations carried out from within the machine defy any mortal definition of torture. The ultimate fate of the twisted angel caged within remains a mystery. Some scholars suppose the angel must surrender to some sort of respite in death. Others whisper fearfully of the unquiet essence that might rise from the broken cage of a devastator-an avenging angel that is filled with dire hatred for the world and that stalks the souls it once swore to protect.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThese sinister machines of pure destruction are all imbued with the corrupted life essence of at least one angel-now twisted into a demented thing filled with the unwholesome urge to sow ruin and agony among its former brethren. Devastators are most often deployed as the guardians of important causeways between the Abyss and invaded territory on other worlds, but occasionally they are assigned to act as the bodyguards or favored toys of particularly powerful demon lords who enjoy having these smoldering monstrosities around in case of a holy raid on their stronghold.\n\nWhen a new Abyssal incursion is launched against a virgin world, a devastator usually leads the advance force, wreaking untold havoc and redefining destruction for the uninitiated civilizations it touches. Three devastators patrol the Worldwound, hunting parties of crusaders and any other strike forces that might seek to seal off this rift to the Abyss. Each of the three is unique in its appearance and armaments. Those few crusaders who have survived encounters with the devastators have invented nicknames to better identify them and share intelligence on how to combat or avoid them. The Grinning Grinder is the most active and infamous at present, but some (clerics especially) fear Faith-Breaker more. The third-Fury Engine-terrified crusaders for many years, but it is rumored that the crimson devastator was destroyed in a suicidal assault by a chorus of angels some 30 years ago. Some, however, claim Fury Engine's fate is more involved, whispering that the angels captured the devastator and then secreted the construct to a remote location on some deserted, lonely plane of existence. There, the angels toil tirelessly in hopes of saving the tormented soul of a powerful planetar trapped within the devastator's hellish interior." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBUlkreth" name="Demon, Ulkreth" description="Ulkreths are among the mightiest servants of the demon lord Xoveron, the Horned Prince of gargoyles and lord of ruination. They exist solely to destroy, carrying out his will of devastation to cities and civilization throughout the planes, tearing down monuments and buildings in the name of their unholy patron. Ulkreths are 25 feet tall and weigh 10 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nUlkreth demons form from the souls of mortals who spread wanton destruction and vandalism, burning and tearing down what others have labored long to build up. Small-scale vandals do not earn damnation for simple graffiti and petty breakage; ulkreths arise from those who devoted their lives to bringing ruin forge their own chain of condemnation with every new act of malicious deconstruction. Some do so by targeting grand works of art, stately monuments, cathedrals, libraries, and historical edifices, destroying not just physical structures but also the artistic and cultural legacy of their own people, or of other cultures living among them. These targets are singled out for defacement as a sign of the vandal's hate. The pinnacle of vandalism, however, is attained by those who not only cause damage to property but also murder via their sabotage-collapsing mines and trapping miners to die choking in the dark; breaching dams and dikes to unleash deadly floodwaters that wreak devastation; or bombing, burning, or otherwise destroying homes, businesses, and other gathering places. Whether done as an anarchic political statement, for revenge upon those who owned the buildings, or for pure psychotic joy at watching the world crumble, these are the blackest-hearted vandals of all.\n\nThe level of destruction perpetrated by mortals in life is important to their lord Xoveron because while his will is bent on the ruination of every civilization, tearing down the literal and figurative structures that hold society together, he is still only a minor demon lord. His power is insufficient to endow every servant with great abilities. Lesser vandals simply do not rate a major investment of his lordly power, and if made into demons at all, may be consigned to eternity as mere dretches, or as fiendish gargoyles rather than actual demons. It is only those whose acts of destruction are truly heinous that inspire him to transform them into ulkreths.\n\nUlkreth demons are unusual, however, in that they can also be formed not from one soul but from many, especially in the case of gangs that once worked together as mortals in their acts of destruction. These joint-souled ulkreths are, if anything, even more savage and destructive than their fellows, as the different soul fragments bound together struggle for mastery, trying to show their dominance by wreaking greater mayhem than their rivals.\n\nUlkreths do not need to eat or drink, but they enjoy chewing and swallowing powdered stone and shattered glass, twisted metal and splintered wood. They consume the detritus of their destruction as a ritual of satisfaction after their rampages. Some say they gain sustenance from these shattered remains and claim that if ulkreths are prevented from destroying for too long, they can actually waste away and die of starvation, though planar scholars know that outsiders don't need to eat to live. Ulkreths cannot reproduce biologically and are propagated only by the transformation of new souls into ulkreths.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nMost ulkreths inhabit the endless ruins of Ghahazi, the hearth of their master Xoveron. There they tend groves of fiendish treants that wait amidst the ruins, crumbling foundation stones with their defiled roots even as they stand ready to batter and smash at the ulkreths' command. Flights of fiendish gargoyles wheel constantly overhead, making aeries of the shattered spires of the Horned Prince's city and flocking ahead of the ulkreths when they march. Xoveron often barters the service of his ulkreths with other demon lords or their generals, especially in siege situations where demonic teleportation is of no avail and defenses must be breached with naked strength. Ulkreths may be kept back as artillery, but they chafe under efforts to suppress their urges to sunder and smash and have often been known to abandon their orders and wade directly into a fray or smash down gates and walls with their bare fists.\n\nOn the Material Plane, the cultists of Xoveron and his gargoyle minions stand sentinel against the encroachment of civilization, ready to foil its ambitious reach towards eternity. When his minions report cities growing too great, too lovely, or too proud, Xoveron tempts mortals with a gluttonous hunger for power and a jealous pride and rage toward their fellows that drives them to call forth a ulkreth demon. Mortal gargoyles can sense the presence of one of their master's favored servants and flock to its side to swoop hooting and screeching overhead as the wrecker commences a reign of terror. Of course, ulkreths are notoriously indiscriminate about their destruction, and those summoning them must be very careful not to become casualties of the ulkreth's rampage." compset="Race">
