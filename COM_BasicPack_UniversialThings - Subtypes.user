A half-construct race has the following features.\n\n• Half-constructs gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue.\n• Half-constructs cannot be raised or resurrected.\n• Half-constructs do not breathe, eat, or sleep, unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a half-construct can drink potions and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither is required to survive or stay in good health." compset="Subtype" uniqueness="unique">
