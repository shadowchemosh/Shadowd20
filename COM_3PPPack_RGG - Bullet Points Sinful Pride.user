  <thing id="fSFPridefl" name="Prideful" description="You have turned your love of your own sense of accomplishment and self-worth into an art form&#133; and a power.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Cha 13.\n \n{b}Benefit{/b}: Your conviction that you are superior to those around you gives you a major boost of self-confidence whenever you encounter evidence to support your massive sense of self-worth. When you roll a natural 20 on an ability check, skill check, attack roll, or saving throw (the die result is a 20), or a foe rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw against an effect or spell of yours, or on an opposed skill check against you, you receive a +1 morale bonus to one of the following (selected at the time you gain the bonus): ability and skill checks tied to Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma (your choice); caster level; or weapon damage. You can only have one bonus from Prideful in effect at a time, and if you use the ability again before an old bonus fades, the original bonus immediately ends." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

Since he knows this is his Stealth check opposed by Khurva&#146;s Perception check, he receives a +3 bonus. If Lady Khurva attempts to sneak past Lord Brevic, he doesn&#146;t know who his Perception check is opposed by, and gains no bonus. If Brevic and Khurva are playing hide-and-seek and the GM rules this is a set of matching opposed Perception and stealth checks, Brvice gains the bonus to both checks." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

You must take the second result, even if it is worse. If your check or roll still fails, you suffer a -2 penalty on checks or rolls of that type (ability check, skill check, or attack roll) for 12 hours." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

You may use dispel magic to counterspell a spell-like or supernatural ability. You must correctly identify the ability with either a Spellcraft check (setting the DC as if you were identifying a spell of the same level as the spell-like ability) or an appropriate Knowledge check for creatures using supernatural abilities (DC 10 + creature&#146;s CR). You must make a caster level check with a DC of 11 + the abilities caster level (if given) or 11 + the hit dice of the creature using the ability. Except as noted above, this ability works as a dispel magic used to counterspell a spell." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
