  <thing id="rhogre" name="Half Ogre" description="The half-ogre is a rare creature, generally born from a forced union. In very rare instances, half-ogres are bred to serve in a particularly vicious army. In either case, a half-ogre&apos;s upbringing is rarely a happy one, as they are tolerated for their usefulness and shown little love. Those half-ogres that do manage to survive to adulthood with their sanity intact are solitary creatures, putting their muscles to use while understanding that most civilized folk will give them a wide berth. The half-ogre much prefers the country to the city, where urban architecture rarely accommodates their bulk. Half-ogres have miserable tempers and are quick to anger, but those that show one kindness will never have a more loyal friend.\n\nPhysical Description:\nWhile technically medium creatures, most half-ogres straddle the line at around 8 feet tall. Like dwarves, half-ogres are stocky creatures for their size. From a distance, a half-ogre can pass as a large human, and many ancient legends about extraordinarily large human warriors probably referred to half-ogres. Up close, the wild stare and unkempt appearance, in addition to his larger height, unmistakably mark one as a half-ogre.\n\nSociety: Half-ogres are solitary creatures since, unless they were bred, there are no known half-ogre communities. Most half-ogres are born into roving ogre bands and are too frail in such instances to live very long. Other half-ogres are raised in human communities but rarely treated as an equal. Perhaps due to their shame, half-ogres prefer the company of humans or ogres rather than with other half-ogres.\n\nRelations: Half-ogres get along well with half-orcs, especially since they share similar life experiences. Half-ogres also get along with humans who find their strength useful for labor and military purposes. The smaller races tend to be intimidated by half-ogres and the feeling is mutual; half-ogres fear that gnomes or halflings can play tricks on them or steal their stuff without getting caught. Half-ogres don&apos;t enjoy the company of elves or half-elves, as they often have the beauty, grace, and acceptance that was denied to the half-ogre.\n\nAlignment and Religion: A half-ogre tends to follow the same religions as does the human or ogre community in which she grew up, usually choosing a deity that favors strength or war. Half-ogres tend to be neutral creatures, remaining aloof from society while relying on others for needed supplies, offering their strength in return.\n\nAdventurers: For the obvious reasons, half-ogres gravitate toward the non-lawful martial classes, such as barbarian, fighter, and warlord. Half-ogres usually lack the temperament to be monks, paladins, or rangers. While generally not spellcasters, half-ogre shamans, sorcerers, and warlocks are not unknown." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rRatkin" name="Ratkin" description="Ratkin are not a true race; they are the result of experimentation on dire rats. Every ratkin knows the story even if the specifics are blurred or contradictory. An ancient wizard (or other caster) needed servants and used the materials he had, namely giant rats. These stories often include a ratkin insurrection against their master, although bards and scholars tend to agree that this master, if he existed, was more likely vanquished by an enemy and the ratkin were left to fend for themselves. Hated by other races, the ratkin learned to band together, surviving on the scraps and trash of other races.\n\nPhysical Description: Ratkin generally look like humanoid rats, roughly human size with a rat&#146;s head and tail and covered in hairy fur. This unfortunately makes them resemble were-rats and many small ratkin communities were wiped out during a were-rat infestation &#147;just to make sure.&#148;\n\nSociety: Ratkin tend to form small tribes or bands, living in areas that other races avoid. In the cities, ratkin congregate in slums or sewers. While ratkin appreciate protective laws, they are unconvinced that the authorities have their interests at heart.  In the wild, ratkin form bands that follow more aggressive tribes, picking the scraps left over from vicious raids.\n\nRelations: Ratkin tend to get along with other &#147;outcast&#148; races, such as half-ogres, half-orcs, and saurians, or any race that is a minority in the geographic area. As ratkin have a reputation for being dirty disease carriers, most races give them a wide berth. Still, a ratkin may be tolerated when isolated from other ratkin, and his skills often determine his worth.\n\nAlignment and Religion: As a created race, the ratkin have no patron deity. Instead, ratkin approach religion as they do everything else; they generally worship deities that have been discarded or fallen out of favor within a particular pantheon.\nRatkin priests occupy abandoned temples to such deities and fuse old remnants of rituals with ratkin philosophy. Ratkin tend to be neutral in alignment and rarely good.\n\nAdventurers: Ratkin favor speed and stealth over brute force and martial ratkin tend to be rangers and swashbucklers. This also accounts for there being more ratkin priests than clerics (and, since ratkin don&#146;t feel a connection to the natural world,\nfew are druids or shamans). As befitting a race of scavengers, a large number of ratkin are rogues. While magically created, ratkin have had little interbreeding and as such arcane casters tend to be wizards rather than sorcerers and warlocks." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rSaurian" name="Saurian" description="Saurians are an ancient, noble race. The Saurian civilization was old when the other races were born, having survived the catastrophes that periodically cleanse the world. Ancient saurian scrolls tell of a time when the world was covered in jungle and giant reptiles stomped across the continents. Perhaps because of this pedigree, modern saurians feel a bit out of place in the modern world. While a proud, civilized people, the saurians are slow to adapt and lost much of their civilization during the last great catastrophe.\n\nNow scattered across a colder, unforgiving world, saurians maintain as much of their ancient traditions as possible while acknowledging their status as a dying breed. The typical saurian is stubborn, stoic, and resolute. His pragmatic approach and willingness to accept the inevitable sometimes and unfairly labels him as defeatist.\n\nPhysical Description: Saurians are slightly taller and bulkier than humans. Saurian skin is leathery and ranges from chalk white to deep yellow. Most of their bodies are covered in fine scales that are usually metallic in color. Saurians don&apos;t like to wear too much clothing and prefer breastplates and greaves to full suits of armor. In spite of their reptilian appearance, saurians are mammals and give birth to live young.\n\nSociety: Saurians have an almost tragic worldview, as they feel that the world has moved on without them. Most saurians are solitary creatures, although small bands occasionally gather in an isolated city-state, manor, or &quot;saurian quarter.&quot; The changing world has weeded out the weakest among them, leaving the solitary saurian to practice the martial or arcane discipline that helped his ancestors survive.\n\nRelations: Saurians often take a paternalistic view towards other races, as they see themselves as the epitome of a particular discipline or lifestyle and they want to impart their wisdom on the younger races. Unfortunately, this is often misunderstood and is mistaken for arrogance or stubborness (although it is true in some cases). Saurians don&apos;t get along well with chaotic races, such as elves or half-orcs, as they tend to lack the comfortable predictability that saurians thrive on.\n\nAlignment and Religion: Saurians have little use for religion; they feel that their gods either abandoned them or died out. Saurians instead pledge themselves to philosophies, and it is through these philosophies that some saurians manifest divine powers. Most saurians are lawful and feel that their civilization fell due to chaos.\n\nAdventurers: Saurians adventure for a variety of reasons, usually related to their class. Saurian fighters, knights and spellblades go to battle to hone their skills and defend the weak, while saurian priests, sorcerers and wizards scour ruins for lost knowledge. Saurians tend to have small skill sets tempered with a healthy dose of honor. Thus, saurians tend to favor the knight and sorcerer classes." compset="Race">
