The use of fire resistant magic is forbidden in these rituals, causing severe burns to many adherents\n{b}Typical Worshippers:{/b} Tulita, fire giants, menehune, creatures of elemental fire, fire cults\n\nPele is the mother figure and creator to the Tulita peoples. Said to reside in the volcano of Fiery Heart north of Port Shaw, only the extremely devout or extremely foolish would dare to approach her fuming home. Fiery, furious, and full of wrath it was by her will that the isles of the Razor bubbled up from the oceans, and this activity continues as she brings the smoldering lava from her heart to pierce the cold waters to continually make new islands. Despite her role as the creator of the People, the Tulita do not picture her as a maternal figure but rather as a vengeful matriarch who demands of them purity and devotion lest they face the purifying wrath of her molten anger. She is a ruthless defender of her islands and her children and can be called upon to rain vengeance and fury upon those who would dare to exploit them." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

In ancient times, she is said to have raged across the world burning and devouring everything in her path. Legends tell how Lakua Mao almost defeated Pele, however she finally extinguished the dragon&apos;s fires by throwing her into the ocean. During this battle, some tribes of Tulita was able to imprison several of Lakua Mao&apos;s draconic children in magical cauls and inter them in sacred places where they would siphon their magical energy to use it for their own purposes. Now the cults of Lakua Mao are all but extinct as an organized religion. Only a few madmen and pyromaniacs on the fringes of society seek to venerate her name by destroying in fire the world around them." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

It is said that everything that has ever transpired upon or beneath the waves is known by Tohoraha and is remembered, so Tulita and mainlander sailors alike are known to make small offerings to him in order to propitiate him for any past offenses they may have committed. Even the basest pirate has been known on occasion to pitch a chest of gold or spill the blood of some valuable prisoner overboard to prevent any potential wrath from the Whale.

Most major ports have a Chapterhouse of Quell where a sea priest conducts blessings upon the fleets and provides guidance of coming weather patterns. As a god of hearth and home for seafarers, the Chapterhouses of Quell also do charitable work for the poor and destitute of their home cities seeking to ease suffering, feed the poor, and heal the sick. They only charge those who can afford to pay for their services from.\n\nQuell has become the most prevalent god upon the Razor Coast, certainly within Port Shaw, and perhaps supplanting even the veneration of the native gods by the Tulita, such is his influence.

Scars from the infecting bite are prominently displayed among weresharks.\n{b}Form of Worship and Holidays:{/b} Blood moon (the full moon when a group victims of newly infected by the Kiss of Dajobas make their first transformation into weresharks). Worship usually takes place in the form of ritual infection of new populations of victims or wanton slaughter and devouring of such populations. There is little organized worship.\n{b}Typical Worshippers:{/b} Weresharks, sahuagin, sharks, cannibalistic pirates\n\nCast off by his worshippers, Dajobas was hurled into the black depths of the ocean&apos;s deepest rift where the night-waters flow cold and the only sustenance are cold bloodless things, tube worms, and wretched slimy sacs of spur-like bone. There he wallows, his hunger raging, and dreams darkly of revenge and slaughter. His bloody dreams streak through sea and mist, cling like barnacles to passing ships, or crawl a-land, spewed out by the sea like venomous humors. These cancerous thoughts, born from Dajobas&apos; rage and hunger sometimes take hold in the hearts of sahuagin warlords, hunting dire sharks, blood-drenched corsairs and vikings, and priests of other sea gods, led astray by the Shark God&apos;s promise of terrible power." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="deiFGElmar" name="Elmarran" description="Unlike deities of other pantheons, the divine beings worshipped in the Domain of Hawkmoon defy description and subscribe to no single alignment. They have no set forms and no gender. For the purpose of bringing their inscrutable natures closer to human understanding, worshippers have given them names and anthropomorphic characteristics, and attempted at least to surmise their realms of control and the areas they influence. All gods have been assigned a primary dichotomy, and several lesser fields of influence. Because of this complexity, beings of various alignments and vocations might pray to the same deity.\n\nTo this end, those who know Elmarran best-being themselves followers of the sea and the everchanging portents its tide brings-picture him as a withered old man, with wise, dark eyes and a flowing white beard with blue streaks. Elmarran tends toward the chaotic, and since many of his followers have an evil bent, he is sometimes erroneously seen in that light. His influence extends beyond the ocean to rivers and lakes, and many who make their living upon these watery surfaces pay him homage. However, he is also the god of aging, disguise, and change. The old and infirm often send prayer his way, in the hope that they will encounter the final change on peaceful terms. Many sages and philosophers, as they enter their venerable years, take to a worship of Elmarran out of a learned respect for the wisdom that old age brings, and an acquired prerogative to ignore the whims and rules of younger men.\nElmarran is capricious, and many of his followers are of that ilk whose tempestuous passions randomly change course as a ship driven before the storm.\n\nTypical Worshippers: sailors, the elderly, sages, spies, actors, philosophers, fishermen, and the temperamental." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
