  <thing id="fMCld2Cld" name="Cloud-To-Cloud" description="Your lighting spells can light up a magic cloud of your creation.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Spell Focus (conjuration and evocation), Knowledge (nature) 7 ranks, ability to cast a cloud spell (see benefit), ability to cast a spell with the electricity descriptor.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you have cast a &#147;cloud&#148; spell (a spell that has cloud, fog, haze, mist, or vapor in the title, has a duration of 1 round per level or longer, and creates an area with vapor of some kind) and you cast a spell with the &#147;electricity&#148; descriptor so its area includes the cloud spell or targets a subject within the cloud spell, you may have the electricity spell affect all targets within the area of the cloud spell. All creatures affected by the spell (even those outside the cloud but within the spell&#146;s normal area) take half the spells normal damage.\n\nIf the electricity spell normally allows a saving throw or requires an attack roll, each target must be attacked and/or receives the appropriate save. If the spell allows a save for half damage, a successful save results in no damage). If the electricity spell normally has an effect other than dealing damage, that effect only applies to creatures within its normal area or that are targeted by the spell normally (creatures that would have been affected by the spell even without the Cloud-To-Cloud feat). \n\nUsing this feat reduced the remaining duration of the cloud spell used to extend the electricity spell by 50%." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
