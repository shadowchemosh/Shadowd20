This allows you to grant the spell one or more effects that duplicate the following weapon special abilities: anarchic (only if you are of chaotic alignment), axiomatic (only if you are of lawful alignment), disruption (only if the spiritual weapon takes the form of a bludgeoning weapon), flaming, flaming burst, frost, grayflame*, holy (only if you are of good alignment), icy burst, keen, merciful, shock, shocking burst, speed, or unholy (only if you are of evil alignment). Adding these properties consumes an amount of attack bonus from Wisdom equal to the property&#146;s base price modifier.\n\n*Indicates a weapon special ability found in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide." compset="Feat" summary="You can combine your knowledge of magic weapons with your ability to evoke a spiritweapon." uniqueness="useronce">
