  <thing id="fMCmtStrke" name="Cometstrike" description="Prerequisites: Ability to cast fireball, ability to cast an evocation spell with an area defined as a line.\n\nBenefit: When you cast fireball (or other evocation spell with a medium or greater range and a defined area of a 20-ft.-radius-spread), you can change the spell so it forms a 5-footdiameter streaking comet of energy. The spell&#146;s area becomes a line up to short range (25 ft. +5 ft/2 levels) that ends in an explosion with a 10-ft.-radius spread. The comet streaks past any object in the line less than 5-feet in diameter (damaging it normally), preventing the premature detonation a typical fireball suffers when striking such an object. Larger objects simply stop the Cometstrike, without causing a detonation." compset="Feat" summary="Your fireball is a churning, comet-like sphere of destruction that burns everything in its path." uniqueness="useronce">

You may decide what targets (creatures &amp; objects) are affected by your fireball, allowing allies and objects you do not wish to harm to be totally unaffected by the spell.

Because of the quick flash detonation, the spell deals 1 less hp of damage per die. You make a special drag* combat maneuver against all creatures completely engulfed in the explosion (making one roll, and comparing it to the CMD of each target), with a CMB of (caster level + spell level). Creatures only partially within the area of the spell take damage normally, but are immune to the drag maneuver. Targets effected by the drag maneuver are pulled toward the center of the explosion. If 2 or more creatures are pulled to the center of the spell, they are knocked prone.\n\nPerforming this special push maneuver does not provoke attack of opportunity, thought casting the evocation spell does unless it is cast defensively.\n\n*Combat maneuver found in the {i}Advanced Player&#146;s Guide{/i}." compset="Feat" summary="Your fireball can suck foes into the center of its area" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMEnvEffct" name="Environmental Effects" description="Prerequisites: Spell Focus (evocation), Spell Focus (transmutation), ability to cast fireball.\n\nBenefit: When you cast fireball, or another evocation (fire) spell with a defined area (rather than an effect or targets), if one of the materials listed below fills a volume within the spell&#146;s area that is at least equal to a 5-foot-cube, you may have the spell act in the manner listed in the appropriate entry below. The material need not be in a single mass &#150; if you cast a fireball in a forest and the GM rules the shrubbery and trees within its area add up to a total of 5-foot-cube, you may call upon the effects listed with wood/plants, below.\n\n{i}Dirt/Earth/Stone{/i}: The spell&#146;s area fills with noxious gases as the earth is vaporized. Targets that fail their saving throw against the spell must make a Fortitude save against the same DC. If they fail this save, they are sickened and lose the ability to smell for a number of rounds equal to half the spell&#146;s level (minimum 1 round).\n\n{i}Ice/Water{/i}: The spell&#146;s area is filled with superheated steam, able to both burn and melt as fire, but also dousing fires within its area. Against most creatures and targets the spell deals fire damage, but against creatures of the fire type, the wet steam counts as cold damage.\n\n{i}Metal{/i}: Part of the fire energy from the spell superheats the metal in the area. Because some fire energy is used to heat the metal, it deals 1 less point of damage per die. The lingering heat causes the spell&#146;s area to continue to deal heat damage (at the beginning of your turn) to all creatures in it. The heat damage is equal to 1 hp per 2 dice of the original spell, and it continues to radiate for 1 round per level of the spell.\n\n{i}Wood/Plants{/i}: The spell&#146;s area is filled with brightly burning plant material. Targets within the area that fail a save against the spell are dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the spell&#146;s level." compset="Feat" summary="Your fireball creates secondary effects depending on the environment in which you cast it." uniqueness="useronce">
