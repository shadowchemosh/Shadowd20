  <thing id="fMEldArmor" name="Eldritch Armor" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Spell Focus (abjuration or conjuration) or Spell Penetration.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: As a swift action you can attune a force spell that grants you a bonus to AC (such as mage armor or shield) to deflect antimagic energies, making it more difficult to dismiss magic within the spell&#146;s defensive aura (spells affecting you personally and items held or worn by you). If a spell affects you and other targets, only the magic on you gains this protection. The DC of caster level checks to dispel or destroy magic and magic items on your person (such as with dispel magic or greater dispel magic) are increased by the armor bonus granted by the attuned spell, while Will saves you make to prevent magic effects and items on your person from being destroyed or suppressed (such as when resisting a mage&#146;s disjunction) gain a bonus equal to the armor bonus granted by the attuned spell. Bonuses granted by multiple attuned force spells do not stack. You may also end a spell&#146;s attunement with a swift action." compset="Feat" summary="You can attune your defensive force spells to protect against efforts to dismiss your personal magic" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMMArmProp" name="Mage Armor Properties" description="{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Craft Magic Arms &amp; Armor, ability to cast mage armor, caster level 5.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you cast mage armor, you can reduce the armor bonus to AC it grants you in order to add magic armor properties to the effect of the spell. When you add properties, you reduce the AC bonus of the mage armor spell by an amount equal to the bonus cost of the property. You cannot reduce the mage armor&#146;s armor bonus by more than 50% in this way. If the target of the mage armor gains an armor bonus to AC from other source that is greater than the armor bonus granted by the mage armor spell, the magic armor properties of the spell do not function. The magic properties of any armor (but not shield) worn by the target that grants an armor bonus to AC less than that of the mage armor spell are suppressed for the duration of the spell. You may add the following magic properties to your mage armor spell: fortification (light, moderate, or heavy), invulnerability, or spell resistance." compset="Feat" summary="You can add the magic properties of magic armor to your mage armor spell" uniqueness="useronce">

You can shift its protection to focus more heavily on vital areas of the target&#146;s body &#150; for every 1 point reduction in the mage armor&#146;s armor bonus to AC, the mage armor spell gives a +2 armor bonus to the target&#146;s AC against attack rolls made to confirm a critical hit.
