  <thing id="pAP39SpMD" name="Saventh-Yi Spear: Military District" description="The seven spears of Saventh-Yhi are more than mere landmarks. They posses powerful magic of their own-it is within these seven monoliths that the anti-entropic magic that protects the city is housed, as well as the nondetection and mirage arcana defenses. Further, each of these spears is infused with still-potent magic from the city&apos;s creation, magic intended to aid and encourage each district to function efficiently in its assigned specialty. These seven magical themes, linked to the seven virtues of rule (which, in ancient Thassilon far to the north, were corrupted into seven deadly sins claimed by that realm&apos;s ruthless Runelords), continue to shape and mold the districts today. The type of creatures that dwell in the city have naturally gravitated to districts in keeping with their own natures and predilections, helping to maintain each district&apos;s theme after all these years. Furthermore, the auras generated by these spears are slightly “addictive,” and over the course of many years, those who live in constant proximity find themselves increasingly uninterested in expanding to other parts of the city-a trait that has helped to keep interdistrict conflict in Saventh-Yhi to a minimum.\n\nAs a result, the seven spears infuse each district with minor but unusual magical effects. Furthermore, the spears can be “activated” if the PCs can decipher the means to do so from the city&apos;s ancient carvings. Once activated, a district&apos;s spear glows momentarily with energy as the rune of its associated virtue flares brightly at its base. The Azlanti used these effects for many purposes-to track the passage of time (each spear would remain active for a different period during a year), to mark festivals, and most importantly, to give each district&apos;s citizens an edge in their assigned professions during times when their work was particularly important to the city. Only one spear can be active at a time-activating a new spear while another is already active causes the previous spear to return to its passive mode.\n\nBy discovering each spear&apos;s activation sequence, the PCs can make Saventh-Yhi an increasingly hospitable place for them to dwell and explore. The advantages granted by an active spear can aid them in offense, defense, and exploration in many ways, and mastering the seven spears can aid tremendously in solving the mysteries posed by the lost city. The passive and active effects of each spear are detailed at the end of this part in the summary of Saventh- Yhi&apos;s locations, while the ritual and method of activation is detailed in each district&apos;s specific entry in the adventure. \n\n{b}Spear Effects{/b}\n{b}Passive{/b} All creatures in this district gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.\n\n{b}Activation Triggers{/b} Anoint the stones of the ziggurat with the lifeblood of a powerful creature (slay a creature of CR 10 or higher), channel energy into the spear (requires one use of channel energy from a cleric who worships a deity associated with combat or wrath), or perform a 1-hour ritual of mock combat before the spear (requires a DC 25 Intimidate check).\n\n{b}Active{/b} Once the spear is activated, all creatures in the district gain a +2 bonus on all melee attack rolls." compset="InPlay" uniqueness="useronce">
