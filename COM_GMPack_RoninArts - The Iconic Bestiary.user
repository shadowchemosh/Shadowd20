  <thing id="wFCLash" name="Lash" description="Evil eyes have no concern for any living being other than themselves (and sometimes other evil eyes). They are capable of fighting with their optic nerve “tails,” but prefer to remain at a distance and make use of their gaze attacks. Unless an evil eye believes itself overmatched, or believes it can bargain with or intimidate potential foes, it attacks without provocation. This is partly due to their obsession with acquiring magic, but also because they enjoy the kill." compset="Weapon">

  <thing id="rFCEvilEye" name="Evil Eye" description="The so-called evil eyes are also known as the Eyes of Augrah-Ma. Legend has it that Augrah- Ma himself (itself?) is some great and dark power; perhaps demon prince, perhaps a god, perhaps something else entirely. His presence is so inherently baleful that the very forces of nature prevent him from entering any of the known planes. It is said that the Augrah-Ma lurks in the emptiness between worlds.The evil eyes, though they seem to have independent minds and often pursue their own agendas, are said to literally be Augrah-Ma&apos;s eyes, allowing him to see and influence events in the material plane. Most evil eyes seem obsessed with the destruction of spellcasters, and the acquisition of magic items. They rarely make use of such items themselves, but sages theorize that they constantly seek some means of allowing Augrah-Ma to enter the world - and to make themselves supreme in his order, rising above all other evil eyes. As such, evil eyes oppose one another as often as they cooperate.\n\nAn evil eye is about 8 feet in diameter, with its “tail”of optic nerves running an additional 3 to 9 feet, depending on the individual. These tails are fully prehensile, allowing the evil eye to manipulate objects as well as human hands. Some are perfectly white, some yellowed, and some bloodshot. An evil eye&apos;s iris can be of any color, from standard blues, greens and browns, to inhuman violets, golds and reds." compset="Race">

At the same time, they are constantly ravenous, and when the opportunity to feed arises, they gorge themselves, to better to ride out the leaner days.

It weighs nearly half a ton. They are capable of burrowing through solid rock, as well as loose earth and soil, though their speed is reduced by one quarter (to 5 feet) when they do so. Tunnel brutes are covered in a hard chitin, which gives them their insectoid appearance. Colors range from black to dark blue to dull yellow to burnt umber.\n\nTunnel brutes communicate among themselves through a complex series of subharmonic sounds, gestures, and pheromones. These pheromones have a debilitating effect on other living beings, causing them to spiral into severe emotional lows.

Survival and victory are their only goals, though they are fully capable of employing subtle or deceptive methods to obtain them.\n\n{b}Combat{/b}\n\nAlthough ophiduan are intrinsically chaotic, their great intelligence and innate cunning allow them to make use of traps and tactics that are extremely ordered, almost lawful, in their design. They eschew direct confrontation, preferring ambushes, traps, feints, and the like. Where possible, they focus on ranged attacks and spells, if necessary sending mercenaries or slaves into close range while remaining distant from the foe.\n\nAll ophiduan have the following abilities, regardless of type.\n\n{b}Immune to Poison (Ex):{/b} The ophiduan have strong constitutions, and are immune to any form of natural poison.

The favored class of the semiferum caste is rogue. The favored class of the hominis caste is cleric, with access to any two of the following domains: Animal, Chaos, Destruction, Evil, Magic, and Trickery. Although not a favored class, wizards are also quite prevalent among the hominis caste, and very nearly equal clerics in number.\n\n{b}Ophiduan Society{/b}\n\nThe ophiduan have a strict caste system, enforced not by societal laws but by physiology. Each of the three subraces has its position in society,and any attempt to rise above it results in swift reprisal from the paranoid ophiduan above them.\n\n{b}Castes :{/b} {i}Ophiduan{/i}, Anguineum Caste, {i}Ophiduan{/i}, Hominis Caste, {i}Ophiduan{/i}, Semiferum Caste\n\nThe hominis caste is the most recent creation of the ophiduan, the final result of centuries of crossbreeding and experimentation. Due to their enhanced abilities, they were swiftly able to rise to a position of leadership of the ophidian nature, becoming both secular and spiritual leaders. The mighty palaces of the ophidian imperatoris (emperors) double as temples, the imperatoris as priests. \n\nThey preside over rituals of dark prayers and blood sacrifice, conducted in the name of gods unheard of in civilized lands. Their cities stand in the midst of thick forests, wild jungles, hidden mountain passes, and anywhere else they can hide from the eyes of humanity. Should anyone draw near enough to see, however, the high walls and sweeping arches of their temples are unmistakable. As befits a race of snake-like creatures, their architecture favors tight spaces, ramps or shallow steps, and rooms built with floors and ledges at various heights. Their tools and weapons are similarly built, favoring flexibility and speed over brute force.\n\nIn addition to their role as leaders and priests, the hominis caste serves as the face of the ophiduan in their rare political dealings with other races, as only they can pass as humans.\n\nThe anguineum caste occupies the roles of low-level politicians, military officers, elite soldiers, bodyguards and craftsmen, while the semiferum caste serves as manual laborers, foot soldiers, and gladiators." compset="RaceSpec" uniqueness="useronce">

Their scales cover the same range of colors as those of the hominis, but are usually duller, and often appear slightly sickly.
